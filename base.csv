However, the large-scale integration of wind and solar energy into the power grid is still challenging and limits the adoption of these new energy sources. Microgrids (MGs) are small-scale power generation and distribution systems that can effectively integrate renewable energy, electric loads, and energy storage systems (ESS). By using MGs, it is possible to consume renewable energy locally and reduce energy losses from long-distance transmission. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based energy management system (EMS) called DRL-MG to process and schedule energy purchase requests from customers in real-time. Specifically, the aim of this paper is to enhance the quality of service (QoS) for customers and reduce their electricity costs by proposing an approach that utilizes a Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms commonly used real-time scheduling methods significantly. © 2023 The Authors.

To address these issues in a comprehensive manner, this paper proposes a data-driven two-level transactive energy management framework, where the upper-level determines the optimal strategies of internal scheduling within MGs and external trading between MGs while the lower-level formulates a Nash bargaining game model for the fair allocation of trading benefits. The uncertainties of renewable energy sources are fully captured by an adjustable data-driven robust optimization approach with an uncertainty set constructed using the robust kernel density estimation (RKDE) as a machine learning technique. The resulting uncertainty set can provide robust scheduling and trading schemes even when the power generation data of wind turbines and photovoltaic systems are contaminated with anomalous samples, whereas conventional sets are not reliable in the case of contaminated data. To preserve the operational independence and information privacy of MGs, the proposed model is solved in a distributed manner by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the augmented Lagrange-based alternating direction inexact Newton (ALADIN) algorithms. ADMM is commonly used in previous studies, but it has low computational efficiency for handling the consensus process among a large number of MGs. This paper applies ADMM and ALADIN to enhance the applicability of the proposed model when the size and complexity of the networks increase. Numerical tests show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and solution methodology in terms of system cost, solution robustness, and convergence speed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:47","2024-01-24 11:21:31","","","","","34","","Sustain.

In order to improve the efficiency and stability of renewable energy sources and energy security in microgrids, this paper proposes an optimal campus microgrid design that includes EV charging load prediction and a constant power support strategy from the main grid. The problem of load variation due to changes in the number of EVs connected to the microgrid will occur, and this paper presents a detailed prediction method and effective solutions. The load profile of EVs connected to the microgrid is simulated using the Monte Carlo (MC) method, taking into account EV owners’ usage habits, including charging options and dwell time, as well as battery parameters, including state of charge (SOC) and size. The simulation results show that the peak-to-valley difference in grid power after adding EVs is close to 14 times due to the uniformity of travel between staff and students. Based on how long EVs stay in the parking place, a charging and discharging policy for participation in grid dispatch is developed, which has reduced the gap between the peak and the valley. This paper gives precedence here for the main grid to provide constant power support, which would limit the electricity consumption of the campus, reduce the dependence on the main grid and moreover increase the utilization of renewable energy by the microgrid. The ideal solution set for this microgrid system model's best configuration is found using the NSGA-II optimization algorithm. To select the most suitable option, the TOPSIS method is employed. The simulation results show that the microgrid system can operate with EV integration in an economical and stable manner. Additionally, the peak-to-valley value and CO2 emissions are reasonably reduced, and the income of EV users is increased. At the same time, the microgrid operator's charging fee for EVs can lower operating costs and also suggests that future microgrid electricity sales will be more accessible and transparent. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:47","2024-01-24 11:17:47","","","","","98","","Sustainable Cities Soc.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe um projeto de microrrede de campus ideal que inclui previsão de carga de carregamento de VE e uma estratégia de suporte de energia constante da rede principal utilizando o método Monte Carlo.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Microgrid; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; Charging (batteries); Charging loads; computer simulation; Distributed energy resources; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric load dispatching; electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicles; energy resource; Energy security; Intelligent systems; Landforms; Microgrid design; Microgrid systems; Monte Carlo analysis; Monte Carlo methods; Monte carlo simulation; Monte Carlo's simulation; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Operating costs; optimization; power generation; Secondary batteries; V2G and G2V; Vehicle-to-grid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It can further contribute to the stable operation of the smart grid. With the development of renewable energy, improving STLF accuracy has become a vital task. Nevertheless, most models based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot effectively extract the crucial features from input data. The reason is that the fundamental requirement of adopting the convolutional neural network (CNN) is space invariance, which cannot be satisfied by the received data, limiting the forecasting performance. Thus, this paper proposes an innovative ensemble model that comprises a densely residual block (DRB), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) layers based on the attention mechanism, and ensemble thinking. Specifically, the DRB is adopted to extract the potential high-dimensional features from different types of data, such as multi-scale load data, temperature data, and calendar data. The extracted features are the input of the Bi-LSTM layer. Then, the adopted attention mechanism can assign various weights to the hidden state of Bi-LSTM and focus on the crucial factors. Finally, the proposed two-stage ensemble thinking can further improve model generalization.

Because, Since the production of renewable energy sources is still in the process of being created, photovoltaic (PV) systems are commonly utilized for installation situations that are acceptable, clean, and simple. This study presents an adaptive artificial intelligence approach that can be used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in solar systems with the help of an embedded controller. The adaptive method incorporates both the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The WOA was implemented to enhance the process of the ANN model's training, and the ANN model was developed using the WOA. In addition to this, the inverter circuit is connected to the smart grid system, and the strengthening of the smart grid is achieved through the implementation of the CMCMAC protocol. This protocol prevents interference between customers and the organizations that provide their utilities. Using a protocol known as Cross-Layer Multi-Channel MAC (CMCMAC), the effect of interference is removed using the way that was suggested. Also, with the utilization of the ZIGBEE communication technology, bidirectional communication is made possible. The strategy that was suggested has been put into practice, and the results have shown that the PV system produces an output power of 73.32KWand an efficiency of 98.72%. In addition to this, a built-in regulator is utilized to validate the proposed model. In this paper, the results of various experiments are analyzed, and a comparison is made between the suggested WOA with the ANN controller approach and others, such as the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based MPPT and the Cuckoo Search (CS) based MPPT. By examining the comparison findings, it was determined that the adaptive AI-based embedded controller was superior to the other alternatives. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

Due to climatic conditions, the nature of the wind energy source is uncertain, and its prediction for day-ahead scheduling is challenging. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was used to predict wind energy before integrating with the SG. The DSM strategy used in this study consists of real-time pricing and incentives, which is a hybrid demand response program (H-DRP). To solve the proposed tri-objective SG scheduling problem, an optimization technique, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), is proposed, which results in non-dominated solutions in the feasible search area. Besides, the decision-making mechanism (DMM) was applied to find the optimal solution amongst the non-dominated solutions in the feasible search area. The proposed scheduling model successfully optimizes the objective functions. For the simulation, MATLAB 2021a was used.

The supply of microgrids' consumers, on the one hand, and the optimal participation of microgrids in the market the next day, on the other hand, are faced with many challenges for microgrid operators. Therefore, this paper presents a two-level framework for day-ahead energy management of microgrids in the presence of wind turbines, solar panels, and electrical energy storage (EES) systems. In the former level, each microgrid predicts the load demand of its consumers, wind speed, and solar irradiance using historical data. In the latter one, the day-ahead scheduling of the microgrids and the power exchange rate are accomplished based on a game strategy. To predict the uncertain parameters, a stochastic method and three different artificial neural networks (ANN) based techniques are used and compared, which ANN-based methods are as follows; 1- conventional ANN (CANN) with single hidden layer, 2- long short-term memory based on deep learning neural network (DLNN), and 3- a hybrid DLNN combined by the water cycle metaheuristic algorithm (HDLNN-WCMA). The simulation results implemented on a modified 33-bus distribution power grid show that the HDLNN-WCMA compared to the CANN method have a more accurate prediction, resulting in a 2.67% reduction in operating costs. The results also show that applying the game theory method are led to a fairly dividing market power. In addition, the study of the impact of EES system on the operation of microgrids showed that the absence of EES system causes a loss of about 5970 kW of wind turbine output power and also a 10.41% increase in operating costs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:48","2024-01-24 11:19:28","","12159-12173","","14","34","","Neural Comput.

To optimize grid operations, enhanced control and management systems are needed given the increased integration of renewable energy sources and the rising demand for sustainable energy options. In order to effectively monitor, regulate, and optimize power and energy systems, this article suggests an intelligent grid management strategy that integrates smart grid technology, cuttingedge analytics, and control algorithms. The suggested intelligent grid management system makes use of real-time data collection from smart metres, sensors, and other grid equipment to facilitate situational awareness and decision-making. In order to analyze the gathered data and extract insights for grid operation and planning, advanced analytics techniques, including as machine learning and optimization algorithms, are utilized. Utilizingthis information will improve power production, load scheduling, energy storage use, and system stability. In order to encourage energy users to modify their energy consumption habits in response to price signals and grid circumstances, the intelligent grid management system also integrates demand response methods. Demand-side management promotes grid stability and resilience by balancing supply and demand, lowering peak loads. In addition, the suggested approach incorporates distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid management procedure, including solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage devices. To maximize their impact on grid performance overall and improve grid resiliency during emergencies, these DERs are coordinated and controlled in a decentralized way. Case studies and simulation results provide as proof of the efficacy of the intelligent grid management strategy. The grid efficiency, energy costs, grid reliability, and integration of renewable energy sources are all improved by the system. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

This calls for self-sustainable IoT ecosystems requiring minimal external resources and intervention, effectively utilizing renewable energy sources, and recycling materials whenever possible, thus encompassing energy sustainability. In this work, we focus on energy-sustainable IoT during the operation phase, although our discussions sometimes extend to other sustainability aspects and IoT lifecycle phases. Specifically, we provide a fresh look at energy-sustainable IoT and identify energy provision, transfer, and energy efficiency as the three main energy-related processes whose harmonious coexistence pushes toward realizing self-sustainable IoT systems. Their main related technologies, recent advances, challenges, and research directions are also discussed. Moreover, we overview relevant performance metrics to assess the energy-sustainability potential of a certain technique, technology, device, or network, together with target values for the next generation of wireless systems, and discuss protocol, integration, and implementation issues.

The purpose of the proposed EMS is to maximize the benefit of all microgrid entities comprising customers and distributed energy resources (DERs). Due to unpredictable features of renewable energy sources and variability of consumers’ demands, designing the microgrid EMS is a complicated task. To overcome this issue, the multi-agent hour-ahead energy management problem is modelled as a finite Markov decision process. The microgrid entities are considered as intelligent agents. The optimal policy of agents is obtained through a newly developed framework of the model-free Q-learning algorithm to maximize the benefit of all renewable and non-renewable energy resources and battery energy storage system. The degradation model of the battery is considered to reduce the number of battery replacements. To ensure customers’ comfort, customers’ expenses are decreased without demand curtailment via introducing two types of load shifting techniques. The microgrid operation is analysed under four scenarios comprising no-learning, generator-learning, customer-learning, and whole-learning. the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the Monte Carlo method and simulation results on the real power-grid dataset show the superiority of the algorithm. © 2023 The Authors.

In this context, several machine learning and deep learning models have been developed during the last decades focusing on energy demand and renewable energy source (RES) production forecasting. However, most forecasting models are trained using batch learning, ingesting all data to build a model in a static fashion. The main drawback of models trained offline is that they tend to mis-calibrate after launch. In this study, we propose a novel, integrated online (or incremental) learning framework that recognizes the dynamic nature of learning environments in energy-related time-series forecasting problems. The proposed paradigm is applied to the problem of energy forecasting, resulting in the construction of models that dynamically adapt to new patterns of streaming data. The evaluation process is realized using a real use case consisting of an energy demand and a RES production forecasting problem. Experimental results indicate that online learning models outperform offline learning models by 8.6% in the case of energy demand and by 11.9% in the case of RES forecasting in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), highlighting the benefits of incremental learning. © 2022 by the authors.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:48","2024-01-24 11:19:37","","","","23","11","","Electronics (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo propõe uma nova estrutura de aprendizagem online (ou incremental) integrada que reconhece a natureza dinâmica dos ambientes de aprendizagem em problemas de previsão de séries temporais relacionados à energia.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I2</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","machine learning; renewable energy sources; energy demand; energy forecasting; incremental learning; MODELS; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Residential energy generation and storage assets, smart home energy management systems, and peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading in microgrids can help integrate and balance decentralized renewable electricity supply with an increasingly electrified power, heat, and transport demand, reducing costs and CO2 emissions. However, these microgrids are difficult to model because they consist of autonomous and interacting entities, leading to emergent phenomena and a high degree of complexity. Agent-based modeling is an established technique to simulate the complexity of microgrids. However, the existing literature still lacks real-world implementation studies and, as a first step, models capable of validating the existing results with real-world data. To this end, we present an agent-based model and analyze the corresponding microgrid performance with real-world data. The model quantifies economic, technical, and environmental metrics to simulate microgrid performance holistically and, in line with state-of-the-art research, consists of self-interested, autonomous agents with specific load profiles, RES generation, and demand-response potential. The model can simulate a P2P marketplace where electricity is traded between agents. In the second part of the paper, we validate the model with data from a medium-sized German city. In this case study, we also compare microgrid performance in 2022, during the energy market crisis in Europe, with historical data from 2019 to assess the effects of energy market shocks. Our results show how microgrids with P2P trading can reduce electricity costs and CO2 emissions. However, our trading mechanism illustrates that the benefits of energy-community trading are almost exclusively shared among prosumers, highlighting the need to consider distributional issues when implementing P2P trading. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:48","2024-01-24 11:17:48","","","","","343","","Appl.

In SG environment, the Smart Meters (SMs) mostly exchange services and data from Service Providers (SPs) via insecure public channel. This makes the entire SG ecosystem vulnerable to various security threats. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we incorporate Digital Twin (DT) technology, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain into the design of a novel SG network. Specifically, a secure communication channel is first designed using an authentication method based on blockchain technology that has the ability to withstand a number of well-known assaults. Second, a new DL architecture that includes a self-attention mechanism, a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, fully connected layers, and a softmax classifier is designed to enhance the attack detection process in SG environments. To deliver low latency and real-time services, the SDN is next employed as the network's backbone to send requests from SMs to a global SDN controller. DT technology is finally integrated into the SDN control plane, which stores the operating states and behavior models of SMs and communicates with SMs. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the blockchain implementation used in the SG network to assess computing time for the various numbers of transactions per block.

In the present study, a sub-critical liquid air energy storage system is designed and comprehensively investigated in terms of energy, exergy, environmental, economic, and exergoeconomic. The objective of this design is to minimize the number of equipment in the liquid air energy storage to reduce its structural complexity, increase its applications, improve the performance, and recover waste cold exergy at the liquefied natural gas regasification terminals. Moreover, a fundamental comparison is performed between five storage systems including the proposed system, the conventional liquid air energy storage, and compressed air energy storage by single-stage and two-stage expansion with reheating to highlight the specific characteristics of the proposed system. In addition, using a combination of the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm, optimal design conditions in terms of thermodynamic and economic performance are presented. The proposed system presents a remarkable performance from various points of view compared to other alternatives by storing 27.20 MWh of excess grid power as liquid air during off-peak periods and exploiting it to generate a power of 182.70 MWh at peak demand times.

Managing different energy markets is one of the biggest challenges for the operators of MESs, since different carriers are traded in them simultaneously. Hence, this paper presents a hierarchical decentralized framework for the simultaneous management of electricity, heat and hydrogen markets among multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) integrated with smart prosumers. The market strategy of MEMGs is deployed using a hierarchical framework and considering the programs requested by smart prosumers. A deep learning-based forecaster is utilized to predict uncertain parameters while a risk-averse information gap decision theory (IGDT)-based strategy controls the scheduling risk. A new prediction-based mechanism for designing dynamic demand response (DR) schemes compatible with smart prosumers’ behavior is introduced, and the results illustrate that this mechanism reduces the electricity and heat clearing prices in peak hours by 17.5% and 8.78%, respectively. Moreover, the results reveal that the introduced structure for hydrogen exchange through the transportation system has the ability to be implemented in competitive markets. Overall, the simulation results confirm that the proposed hierarchical model is able to optimally manage the competitive markets of electricity, heat and hydrogen by taking advantage of the potential of smart prosumers. © 2022 The Authors","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:48","2024-01-24 11:19:49","","","","","333","","Appl.

The primary goal of this framework is to minimize operational costs and power outages for customers by effectively managing the power resources of the hybrid microgrid. These resources include renewable energy sources, battery energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. To obtain accurate results, the costs related to active and reactive powers of diesel generator units are considered in this study. In addition, the uncertainties in the, power generated from renewable energy sources, electric vehicles charging and microgrid demand are modeled using the Monte Carlo Simulation as a scenario generation technique.

The optimization problem considers two objectives, namely, the annual energy losses and the exchange of energy with the higher-level power grid. The decision variables of the problem are the allocation of the different distributed generation units and the battery storage system, the annual power profiles of the controllable distributed generation and the battery storage system, and the power factor profiles of the controllable and noncontrollable distributed generation. All decision variables are solved simultaneously in a single optimization problem. The variable load shapes of the grid consumers and the profiles of the photovoltaic and wind power systems are considered in the study. All data are observed at the annual level with hourly resolution. The problem solving method uses computational intelligence techniques, namely, metaheuristic optimization methods and artificial neural networks. The study proposes a framework for optimizing the decision variables in the planning phase of distributed generation and battery storage, and for controlling the variable power and power factor profiles based on an artificial neural network in the implementation phase. The optimization problem is solved with a power system simulation program and a metaheuristic optimizer in cosimulation synergy.

Diverse renewable energy technologies have been quickly developed to address the energy issue and environmental damage. However, since renewable energy sources are unpredictable and erratic, the widespread use of different renewable energy technologies has consequently put significant strain on the security and dependability of conventional power networks. The Smart Grid (SG) is a modernized electri cal network that makes use of cutting-edge communication, control, and information technology to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources, increase energy efficiency, and improve dependability and security. The invention of computational modeling and evaluation methodologies for SG energy transmission and production networks is the main topic of the research. The Internet of Energy (IoE), which will eventually replace the conventional power production and distribution networks, increases the need to be familiar with the proper computing tools in order to conduct any future SG investigation. The software for simulation that is significant to the modeling and analysis of electrical power production, transmission, distribution, and related systems is examined in this research.

Coordinated management of the microgrid components is crucial for their effectiveness, and this can be very challenging when hosting solar or wind generation. This paper studies the energy management problem of a microgrid based on reinforcement learning algorithms. The advantage of using these algorithms against other optimization and machine learning techniques is that they do not need past experiences to learn a strategy. The learning is based on trial and error experiences, which facilitates its easy implementation to other microgrids while demonstrating their facility to be applied in real cases. In particular, this paper proposes an implementation for an Energy Management System (EMS) in microgrids using the Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Moreover, it compares the proposed algorithm with the Deep Q-Network (DQN). This comparison evaluates the improvement over exploiting the continuous nature of the decision variables against a discretization of the same since the DQN cannot make actions over a continuous space. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:48","2024-01-24 11:22:05","","","","","125","","Eng Appl Artif Intell","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo estuda o problema de gerenciamento de energia de uma microrrede baseado em algoritmos de aprendizado por reforço .

These routines and practices are made up of individual lifestyles and other contextual factors that vary from home to home. Social and psychological theories aim to explain and describe how people consume resources in the home, which has resulted in the development of the home system of practice. This evaluates how occupants live and follow multiple routines which result in varying energy consumption practices. This paper develops a methodology to identify and support the concept of the home system of practice using a data analytical approach and link it to residential energy and distribution network management. This paper utilises k-means cluster analysis to identify these different home systems of practices and routines in energy use by using real-time energy consumption data from July 2019 to March 2021 from a living laboratory in Australia. The results of the analysis show the different daily energy profiles for each of the 39 households, with some homes observing large fluctuations and changes in the way they consume energy during the day. Specific homes were discussed as case studies in this paper focusing on linking the occupants’ contextual factors to their energy profiles. This variation is discussed in terms of the routines of the occupants and associated lifestyles that explain why some energy peaks occurred at different parts of the day and differed during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia. The paper conducts a comparison between these case studies to show how people’s lifestyles impact household energy consumption (and variation). These case studies investigated the heating and cooling practices of the occupants to demonstrate how they impact overall consumption. This variation is discussed in relation to energy management and prediction of when homes will consume energy to assist in net-zero energy developments and grid stabilisation operations. © 2022 by the authors.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:48","2024-01-24 11:17:48","","","","15","14","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Clusterização</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo utiliza análise de cluster k-means para identificar esses diferentes sistemas domésticos de práticas e rotinas de uso de energia, usando dados de consumo de energia em tempo real de julho de 2019 a março de 2021 de um laboratório vivo na Austrália.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","energy management; machine learning; smart grid; Australia; automation; behaviour; cluster analysis; COVID-19; energy use; home system of practice; household energy; net-zero energy home; prediction; residential energy; social practice theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ensures a reliable electricity supply and an efficient operation of the distribution system against disasters with minimum human interaction. In this paper, a fully decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) algorithm, for self-healing in smart distribution systems, is proposed. The novelty of the proposed algorithm, compared to related work, is its ability to combine the zone and feeder agents, specified for system self-healing, with micro-grid agents. This enables the system to successfully achieve functions of fault locating and isolation along with service-restoration using expert rules while considering both operational constraint and load priorities. Meanwhile, managing the power flow and controlling the distributed generator (DG) contribution, in the considered network, is a bonus merit for the proposed algorithm. Hence, system self-healing as well as strengthening energy security and resiliency are guaranteed. The proposed algorithm is tested on a 22 kV radial distribution system through several case-studies with/without a DG wind-energy source.

A two-stage cooperative multi-agent deep RL solution based on deep Q-learning (DQN) with central RL and island agents (IA) spread over several islands has been presented to tackle this difficulty. Because of its in-depth learning potential, deep RL-based systems effectively train and optimize their behaviors across several epochs compared to other machine learning or traditional methods. As a result, the centralized RL-based problem of scheduling charge battery sharing from resource-rich islands (SI) to load island networks (LIN) was addressed utilizing dueling DQN. Furthermore, due to its precise tracking, the case study compared the accuracy of various DQN approaches and further scheduling based on the dueling DQN. The need for LIN is also stochastic because of variable demand and charging patterns. Hence, the simulation results, including energy scheduling through the ship, are confirmed by optimizing RE consumption via sharing across several islands, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by state and action perturbation to guarantee robustness. © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:49","2024-01-24 11:17:49","","86196-86213","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo propõe um sistema de gestão energética de microrredes de redes de ilhas pelágicas (PINMGs) baseado em aprendizagem por reforço (RL) sob o efeito de fatores ambientais e foi apresentada uma solução de aprendizado profundo profunda multiagente cooperativa de dois estágios baseada em deep Q-learning (DQN) com RL central e agentes insulares (IA) espalhados por várias ilhas foi apresentada para resolver esta dificuldade. </p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I2</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Deep learning; Electric loads; Energy management systems; Microgrid; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energy source; Energy management; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Environmental impact; Deep reinforcement learning; Battery; EMS; Generator; Marine vehicles; microgrids; pelagic island; Pelagic island; Renewable energies; renewable energy; Ships; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is prone to new flaws. An economic denial of sustainability attack (EDoS) specifically leverages the pay-per-use paradigm in building up resource demands over time, culminating in unanticipated usage charges to the cloud customer. We present an effective approach to mitigating EDoS attacks in cloud computing. To mitigate such distributed attacks, methods for detecting them on different cloud computing smart grids have been suggested. These include hard-threshold, machine, and deep learning, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF) tree algorithms, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). These algorithms have greater accuracies and lower false alarm rates and are essential for improving the cloud computing service provider security system. The dataset of nine injection attacks for testing machine and deep learning algorithms was obtained from the Cyber Range Lab at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Canberra. The experiments were conducted in two categories: binary classification, which included normal and attack datasets, and multi-classification, which included nine classes of attack data. The results of the proposed algorithms showed that the RF approach achieved accuracy of 98% with binary classification, whereas the SVM model achieved accuracy of 97.54% with multi-classification. Moreover, statistical analyses, such as mean square error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (R), and the root mean square error (RMSE), were applied in evaluating the prediction errors between the input data and the prediction values from different machine and deep learning algorithms. The RF tree algorithm achieved a very low prediction level (MSE = 0.01465) and a correlation R2 (R squared) level of 92.02% with the binary classification dataset, whereas the algorithm attained an R2 level of 89.35% with a multi-classification dataset. The findings of the proposed system were compared with different existing EDoS attack detection systems. The proposed attack mitigation algorithms, which were developed based on artificial intelligence, outperformed the few existing systems. The goal of this research is to enable the detection and effective mitigation of EDoS attacks. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the area required to commission such a renewable-rich microgrid is a major constraint, particularly for the long-term planning of microgrids in urban areas, in addition to the criticality of cost and availability. In this connection, this paper presents a framework for optimally planning a renewable-rich hybrid microgrid with area constraints for energy resources. Considering the criticality, the proposed framework includes the formulation for optimization of twin objectives: the cost of the microgrid and the availability of power in the microgrid. The problem is solved using a Multi-objective approach to minimize the cost, maximize availability, and importantly achieve a feasible generation mix subjected to specified area constraints, a first of its kind. Stochastic algorithms based on genetic and swarm techniques are employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of planning a renewable-rich hybrid microgrid. From the performance analysis, a superior method is identified which is further applied for expansion planning of the considered hybrid microgrid to meet future requirements with limitations on area constraints while taking advantage of modularity associated with renewable sources, a first of its kind. To handle the uncertainties associated with such renewable-rich microgrids, uncertainty analyses are carried out by constructing the utility function and validated using Monte Carlo simulations to rationalize decision-making on system design. It is to note that the results from the proposed method of microgrid planning are found to be effective over the known normal distribution of the considered uncertainty as well. The modeling, decision-making, and uncertainty analyses, are carried out with the help of MATLAB environment. © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:49","2024-01-24 11:17:49","","70873-70883","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta uma estrutura para o planejamento ideal de uma microrrede híbrida rica em energias renováveis ​​com restrições de área para recursos energéticos.

A swift transition to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is essential for saving the planet. Solar energy is one of the most widely used renewable energy solutions, but choosing a PVSC poses a challenging problem that involves considering various factors, such as geographical location and energy consumption patterns. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques to assist users in selecting the most suitable PVSC for their needs. We propose a new framework for PVSC recommendation, which encompasses a PV power forecasting model and a PV configuration recommendation system. We propose two forecasting models, one based on LSTM and the other based on CNN architecture. These two elements are responsible for extracting relevant features from time-series meteorological data, which are then passed to a feed-forward MLP layer that predicts the monthly energy production for different PVSCs. Subsequently, the prediction results are utilized to determine the optimal Residential scale PVSC for households, taking into account location and historical consumption data. The system was trained on simulated data and then tested on both a hold-out simulated test set and a real-world dataset.

The intermittent nature of these sources necessitated the installation of energy storage systems (ESSs) to improve the efficiency and reliability in the power system. Moreover, the ongoing high price of batteries has encouraged the installation of shared ESSs in residential communities. However, managing the shared ESS and the energy flows in the community is considered a key challenge. In order to handle this issue, we introduce a novel energy management system (EMS), namely Energy Management In residential COmmunities with shared storage based on multi-agent systems (EMICO). It finds the optimal energy trading operations between households, as well as the operations of the shared ESS that minimize the total energy losses. We first propose a new cluster-based architecture for the residential community in which we integrate Internet of Energy (IoE) devices to manage energy flows and find the shortest path to transfer energy with minimal loss from a cluster to the other. Then, we model our energy management problem as a constrained optimization problem and we use Lagrange multiplier method to solve it in a centralized way.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have gained great popularity and been widely applied in solar forecasting in recent years. However, conventional AI-based forecasting methods suffer from high variability and stochasticity of solar irradiation, making unreliable predictions due to heterogeneous solar resources. Moreover, the training process of DL models is less flexible and requires immense data. Even for a well-trained model, it can still yield deteriorated performances on other datasets of varying data distributions. To tackle the deficiencies of AI forecasting models, we present a flexible distributed solar forecasting framework based on a novel spatial and temporal attention-based neural network (STANN) in conjunction with federated learning (FL) technique, considering multi-horizon forecasting scenario from 5–30 min. The STANN model consists of a feature extractor and a forecaster, which can be respectively trained on various local datasets for better localization, and updated to further improve forecasting accuracy through global parameter aggregation under the proposed framework without data gathering. We evaluate effectiveness of the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments on real-world datasets and compare it to other popular forecasting models. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the other benchmarks with higher forecasting accuracy for all forecast horizons and better generalization on various datasets, achieving the highest forecast skill of 28.83% at 30 min horizon and an improvement of 11.2% compared with the centralized, localized, and conventional FL training methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:49","2024-01-24 11:17:49","","","","","225","","Build.

While, more than a half of its population lives in big cities, buildings are responsible for nearly the 40 % of the global annual energy consumption. Recent advances in smart grids and the high penetration of renewable energy sources have increased the need for long-term buildings' electricity consumption prediction to support operational decision making, demand response, and the installation of distributed generation systems. In addition, to meet international environmental goals, electric utilities usually offer financial incentives to reduce consumption levels. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems use the half of the buildings' energy to maintain users' comfort. In this scenario, predicting and optimizing their long-term electricity consumption without neglecting comfort conditions become vital to negotiate beneficious service-level agreements (SLAs) within the framework of demand-side management strategies. In this paper, we predict and optimize the one-year-ahead HVAC electricity consumption profile of a reference office building based on a machine learning approach. Although the occupants' number influences the HVAC electricity consumption, there has long been a lack of high-resolution, non-Boolean, long-term occupancy estimators. In this context, we first forecast the one-year-ahead occupants' number schedule and then use it, together with traditionally used historical weather data, to predict the one-year-ahead HVAC electricity consumption. The consumption profile is then optimized based on the estimated one-year-ahead occupants’ count schedule. The best results, obtained with a feedforward neural network, achieve 33 % annual electricity saving without neglecting summer cooling conditions in a hot zone like Miami, being efficient even in energetic-demanding scenarios such as extended working hours. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:49","2024-01-24 11:21:22","","","","","80","","J.

Hence, it is necessary to rely on smart energy storage systems (SESS) to mitigate the fluctuation of RES on the supply side. SESS can be achieved by using demand response management (DRM), i.e., by aggregating thermostatically controlled loads using state-of-art smart grid technologies. In this paper, the air conditioners (ACs) are aggregated into a virtual energy storage system (VESS) by employing an electric model of the ACs. A simple mathematical model was described to evaluate the charging and discharging pattern of the load in terms of power and energy. Based on the VESS, the temperature control strategy was designed to reduce the power consumption of the ACs when making sure the room temperature is below the permissible limit. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was designed to predict the energy capacity of ACs, using which the VESS is achieved. Besides, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm was implemented in the back-propagation of the ANN model to achieve the optimum prediction values. Four case studies were presented to demonstrate the energy-saving capacity of ACs by regulating the set point temperature of a selected site. The results illustrate the change in the power consumption pattern of the ACs with and without employing them for virtual energy storage (VES). Hence, the proposed ANN model enables the aggregators to achieve the desired VES without affecting the comfort of the occupants. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:49","2024-01-24 11:17:49","","","","","208","","Electr Power Syst Res","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p> Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe um modelo de rede neural artificial para prever a capacidade energética dos condicionadores de ar, através do qual o sistema virtual de armazenamento de energia é alcançado.

The modular nature of solar energy has made it possible to utilize it in a variety of applications without any adverse economic impact. In this research, a 5 MW grid-connected solar PV plant was modelled using various ANN networks namely Cascade forward backdrop, ELMAN back prop, Feed forward back prop, Feed forward Distribute Time delay, Layer current and Regression Analysis to identify the impact of various environmental parameters on the PV power generation. Comparatively the Lavenberg- Marquardt model is obtained as a reliable model for smart grid system especially for solar PV power prediction with high R value of 0.9966. Also, the plants real time annual energy production, performance ratio (PR), and capacity utilization factors (CUFs) were analysed under various geometrical condition. The shading losses of the entire PV plant was evaluated using PV SYST software at different tilting conditions (seasonal and fixed tilt). Further, the annual PV generation and energy consumption of the plant is calculated under various load conditions. Out of the total energy consumption of the plant, only 11.2 % of the load will be handled by the 5 MW solar PV plant. Compared with fixed tilt, the proposed optimized tilt increased PR and CUF values to 48.5 % and 9.3 % for the months of November and December, respectively (excluding Sunday maintenance). During Sunday, energy loss was nearly 5248 kWh/day due to improper shutdown of power control units. With proper supply management schemes, the average power saving was nearly 48,000 kWh/year and the total cost saving was nearly INR 38 lakh per year.

In this paper, multi-agent reinforcement learning is used to control a microgrid in a mixed cooperative and competitive setting. The agents observe fluctuating energy demand, dynamic wholesale energy prices, and intermittent renewable energy sources to control a hybrid energy storage system to maximise the utilisation of the renewables to reduce the energy costs of the grid. In addition, an aggregator agent trades with external microgrids competing against one another and the aggregator to reduce their own energy bills. For this, the algorithm deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) and multi-agent DDPG (MADDPG) are used to compare the use of a single global controller versus multiple distributed agents, along with the single and multi-agent variants of distributional DDPG (D3PG) and twin delayed DDPG (TD3). The research found it is significantly more profitable for the primary microgrid to sell energy on its own terms rather than selling back to the utility grid, and is also beneficial for the external microgrids as they also reduce their own energy bills. The methods that produced the greatest profits were the multi-agent approaches where each agent has its own reward function based on the principle of marginal contribution from game theory. The multi-agent approaches were better able to evaluate their performance controlling individual components of the environment which allowed them to develop their own unique policies for the different types of energy storage system. © 2022 The Authors","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:49","2024-01-24 11:21:36","","","","","318","","Appl.

By utilizing regenerative braking energy (RBE) and renewable energy resources (RERs) along with energy storage systems (ESSs), these SRSs can participate in the prosumer market. The uncertainties of RERs in SRSs due to meteorological factors have been studied in the literature. However, there is a research gap in developing a stochastic method for optimized operating of SRSs considering the RBE uncertainties besides the RER, load, and number of passengers’ uncertainties. In this paper, a new probabilistic clustering-based framework for the optimal operation of SRSs is presented. By applying Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), several scenarios are generated and then clustered by the k-means algorithm. The introduced method is applied to an actual SRS in Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway Operation Company. The test results of the MCS, deterministic, and proposed scenario-based approaches are compared to illustrate the proposed method. Test results imply that the related error of the scenario-based method under the real-time pricing can be less than 4.4%, while the computation time significantly decreases.

The key feature of the suggested methodology is the incorporation of objective functions and dynamic models as constraints in the predictive formulation of both primary and secondary layers in the microgrid control hierarchy.

Along with the integration of virtual impedance, second-order generalized integrator phase-lock loop, and harmonic suppression constraint functions, the proposed control scheme shows great response against all variations of load changes, communication delay, communication network failure, and Plug-n-Play capability test.

This integration is possible after energy conversion and energy conversion causes the degradation in the quality of electric power. The power quality can be enhanced by reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) in energy conversion. In this paper, we have presented an improved artificial neural network (ANN) based approach that can be useful to reduce the THD levels in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverter (MLI). The proposed ANN architecture consists of only one hidden layer with ten neurons and can generate accurate results in both overfitting and underfitting conditions. Due to a smaller number of neurons, the proposed architecture is less complex and can produce results relatively faster as compared to other ANN architectures available in the literature. The proposed ANN architecture is tested on an asymmetrical CHB MLI, and the results are compared with the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. The CHB MLI under test had three DC voltage sources with 1:2:4 and inductive loads. The simulations are performed in MATLAB and Simulink environment and the switching angles are optimized by using the ANN architecture. The results have shown a 71.95% improvement in current THDs and a 13.91% improvement in voltage THDs as compared to the SOTA technique. The proposed configuration is 89.6% efficient on inductive load and uses a smaller number of switches.

Due to the conflicting interests of decision-makers in an active DN, the optimization problem has a hierarchical structure, with distribution companies (Discos) at the top attempting to maximize profits and microgrids at the bottom attempting to reduce costs. This study examines the relationship between the unpredictability of renewable energy sources and power demand. In this mechanism, the influence of the demand response program (DRP) is also considered an important aspect of intelligent systems. The two-level nonlinear optimization problem has been transformed to a one-level linear problem using dual theory and KKT conditions.

The evolution of renewable energy sources and their increased penetration into traditional grid systems has increased the complexity of electric power transmission and distribution. The significant increase in the use of complex converters, Flexible AC Transmission System devices and complex nonlinear loads in modern power systems have amplified the issues associated with the production and distribution of electricity having proper PQ. The proper functioning of the power system network requires healthy quality of power, maintained both at the load and source end. The Dynamic Voltage Restorer is a prospective D-FACTS (Distribution Flexible AC Transmission System) device that has been widely incorporated for addressing the PQ issues caused by irregularities in the distribution grid's voltage, current, or frequency. This research article attempts to enhance PQ indices of Photovoltaic, Fuel Cell, DVR and energy storage (battery) based Microgrid systems through a proposed Scaled Conjugate based Artificial Neural Network (SC-ANN) in the Matlab/Simulink architecture. The suggested technique's effectiveness is verified by introducing severe PQ faults such as sag and swell and numerous power system responses have been comprehensively studied by comparing them with traditional Fuzzy Logic Controller and Proportional Integral controllers. The results obtained validates the efficiency of the proposed controller over FLC and PI methods in maintaining the system power indices constant during the onset of PQ faults by reducing harmonics and oscillations thereby enhancing the overall system reliability, efficiency and stability paving its way for real-time implementation in the areas of MG system. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:50","2024-01-24 11:17:50","","520-541","","","80","","Alexandria Engineering Journal","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo tenta melhorar os índices PQ de sistemas de microrrede baseados em fotovoltaicos , células de combustível, DVR e armazenamento de energia (bateria) por meio de uma proposta de rede neural artificial baseada em conjugado escalonado (SC-ANN) na arquitetura Matlab/Simulink.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Electric power system control; Microgrid; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Microgrids; Controllers; Neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Artificial Neural Network; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Computer circuits; Dynamic voltage restorer; Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR); Dynamic voltage restorers; Flexible AC transmission systems; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic controller; Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC); Fuzzy logic controllers; Microgrid (MG); Power Quality (PQ); Proportional integral; Proportional Integral (PI); Real time control; Sag; Swell; Two term control systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decentralization and transparency of blockchain technology have several advantages for data management, security, and trust. In particular, the uses of smart contracts can provide automated transaction in energy trading. Individual entities (household, industries, institutes, etc.) have shown increasing interest in producing power from potential renewable energy sources for their own usage and also in distributing this power to the energy market if possible. The key success in energy trading significantly depends on understanding one’s own energy demand and production capability. For example, the production from a solar panel is highly correlated with the weather condition, and an efficient machine learning model can characterize the relationship to estimate the production at any time. In this article, we propose an architecture for energy trading that uses smart contracts in conjunction with an efficient machine learning algorithm to determine participants’ appropriate energy productions and streamline the auction process.

Renewable energy resources are challenged by their dependency on unpredictable weather conditions. For instance, solar energy hinges on clear skies, and wind energy relies on consistent and sufficient wind flow. However, as a consequence of the finite supply and detrimental environmental impact associated with non-renewable energy sources, it is required to reduce dependence on such non-renewable sources. This can be achieved by precisely predicting the generation of renewable energy using a data-driven approach. The prediction accuracy for electric load plays a very significant role in this system. If we have an appropriate estimate of residential and commercial load, then a strategy could be defined for the efficient supply to them by renewable and non-renewable energy sources through a smart grid, which analyzes the demand-supply and devises the supply mechanism accordingly. Predicting all such components, i.e., power generation and load forecasting, involves a data-driven approach where sensitive data (such as user electricity consumption patterns and weather data near power generation setups) is used for model training, raising the issue of data privacy and security concerns. Hence, the work proposes Federated Smart Grid (FedGrid), a secure framework that would be able to predict the generation of renewable energy and forecast electric load in a privacy-oriented approach through federated learning. The framework collectively analyzes all such predictive models for efficient electric supply. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:50","2024-01-24 11:17:50","","","","24","16","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>o trabalho propõe Federated Smart Grid (FedGrid), uma estrutura segura que seria capaz de prever a geração de energia renovável e prever a carga elétrica em uma abordagem orientada à privacidade por meio de aprendizagem federada.

For net load forecasting, many approaches like statistical models, machine learning, and deep learning have been developed. Because of the significant uncertainty of RES, these models suffer from poor forecasting accuracy. In this study, we propose the TransformGraph, a novel Transformer model for electricity net load forecasting, which combines the Transformer and graph convolutional network (GCN). Firstly, the GCN is used as an input embedding layer to encode multivariate input sequences, which can fill the gap that the correlation information is not thoroughly considered in the Transformer. Then, the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer is used to capture the temporal dependence of the sequence data. Finally, the predicted load values are output using a feed forward neural network. Data from three countries derived from Open Power System Data (OPSD) sources are employed for the case study. Comparisons between the TransformGraph and the other five forecasting models demonstrate that the proposed one has higher forecasting accuracy and stability. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:50","2024-01-24 11:17:50","","2705-2717","","","9","","Energy Rep.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo propõe o TransformGraph, um novo modelo de Transformer para previsão de carga líquida de eletricidade, que combina o Transformer e a rede convolucional gráfica (GCN). </p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I2</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Deep learning; Renewable energy source; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Electric power plant loads; Load forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Convolution; Convolutional networks; Electric load forecasting; Electricity load forecasting; Feedforward neural networks; Graph convolutional network; Graph neural networks; Load forecasting model; Time series; Times series; Transformer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inherent variabilities of these power entities introduce uncertainties that affect the economical operations and integrity of the electrical grid. Thus, optimal power flow (OPF) studies must be conducted at high granularity in order to account for these fluctuations. However, due to the non-convex nature of the OPF problem, solving it in real-time still remains an open challenge. In this paper, a novel data-driven approach that combines generative learning, information theory and domain knowledge is proposed to enable real-time OPF studies. In order to train this model, only feasible datapoints are necessary - not optimal values. Once trained, the time required to compute the solution is extremely fast and falls within the sub-second range. No information pertaining to the topology or power flow equations is required once the model is trained.

In such microgrids, the installation of two or more battery energy storage (BES) units is utilized to compensate the power imbalance between the sources and loads. Nevertheless, energy management with numerous BES units does not simultaneously consider the impacts of distributed generators (DGs) and constant power loads (CPLs). Since the inaccurate current sharing will shorten the lifetime of the batteries and cause instability problem, this article proposes a distributed secondary $H_{\infty }$ consensus approach based on the dynamic event-triggered communication method to realize accurate current sharing and efficient operation in the presence of numerous DGs and CPLs. First, the whole state-space function model of the dc microgrid consisting of DGs, batteries, resistive loads, and CPLs, is first built in detail. This model is further transformed into standard linear heterogeneous multiagent systems, which provides an indispensable preprocessing for advanced control strategy application. Then, the distributed secondary $H_{\infty }$ consensus approach based on the foresaid systems is designed to achieve accurate current sharing. For reducing the communication among batteries and the controller updating frequency, the dynamic event-triggered communication method is proposed. Compared with existing event-triggered methods, the communication and controller updating frequency of the proposed dynamic event-triggered method have been reduced a lot. Additionally, the proposed method can not only avoid the Zeno behavior, but also obtain the lowest bound of the sampled time interval. Finally, the numerical simulation results and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. © 2013 IEEE.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:50","2024-01-24 11:17:50","","5692-5701","","9","52","","IEEE Trans.

It is an indispensable preprocessing for controller design. Furthermore, the fully distributed current sharing control strategy is proposed through adaptive coupling weights. Note that the global communication network structure information demand is eliminated. Moreover, the fully distributed dynamic edge-event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce communication bandwidth.

This study proposes a multi-energy trading strategy for multi-energy microgrids that considers carbon tax policies to boost the low-carbon management of multi-energy microgrid clusters. First, a carbon emission accounting model with energy-carbon coupling is constructed to clarify the carbon emission transfer generated by energy transactions among multiple agents and to achieve accurate accounting of carbon emissions from each multi-energy microgrid. Second, the Nash-Harsanyi bargaining game theory is used to establish an energy trading alliance for multi-energy microgrid clusters. A profit allocation mechanism is designed to reflect the marginal contribution of each player to the economic and environmental effectiveness of the alliance. Finally, different carbon emission accounting methods and profit allocation mechanisms are compared. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the carbon emissions accounting model and the proposed energy trading strategy.

The multi-objective DSM–DEED problem is optimized by class topper optimization algorithm. In addition, an energy management algorithm (EMA) is proposed for optimal power utilization from various energy sources and to match the load demand with generated energy in presence of uncertainties of RESs. To get an accurate model, a random forest regression-based machine learning approach is considered in this paper to predict load demand, wind, and solar power on an hourly basis for a span of 24 hours. The objective here is to optimally schedule load consumption and power generation patterns simultaneously for a day to improve load factor, minimize operational cost, and maximize the profit of all the candidates of the electricity market simultaneously.

These can range from nationwide grids, utility-scale systems, microgrids, data-centers to electric vehicles and can consist of renewable energy sources, fossil-fuel energy, transmission lines, batteries, generators, ultracapacitors and transformers, to name a few. The goals of such systems are typically to balance the load, guarantee the power supply for each device, maximize overall efficiency and to minimize overall losses. Remarkable increases in desktop computing have opened up the possibility for researchers and practitioners to construct and tailor simulation paradigms for their own specific system’s needs. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to develop a flexible and rapidly computable framework that researchers can easily alter and manipulate for their specific system. The approach taken in this work is to study a model problem, consisting of an energy supplier and a large number of strongly coupled devices with specific needs. The framework computes an energy balance for each device in the system and ascertains what the energy supplier must deliver or extract from the device to allow it to meet a specific target state while accounting for transmission losses. A digital-twin is created of such a system that is capable of running at extremely high speeds and which is coupled to a genetic-based machine-learning algorithm in order to optimize the operation of the supplier.

Therefore, the integration of information and communication technologies in sites with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) is needed to monitor and control the DERs operation. In this scheme, a local controller is installed at each DER site to interact with the centralized applications at the grid level and the power equipment at the site level. This local controller uses client–server protocols (e.g., Modbus TCP/IP and IEC 61850 Manufacturing Message Specification) to communicate with different power equipment in the Private Area Network (PAN) of the site. Such protocols often lack information confidentiality and integrity mechanisms. As a result, the smart grids become vulnerable to cyber-attacks. To safeguard smart grid applications, this paper proposes a Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System approach (HNIDS), where machine learning-based anomaly and signature-based are combined. The proposed methodology detects and classifies Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks in eavesdropping mode in PANs, without violating customer privacy. The ability to detect unknown MITM attack techniques, identify affected packets, and determine the victim device(s) are the major advantages of this approach. An experimental testbed has been used to collect real-life data and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in smart grid applications. The proposed HNIDS is evaluated using a simulation as well as real-life laboratory experiments, demonstrating very high accuracy in detection rate, from 97.6% to 100%, with an average of the weighted F1-score over 98%. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:20:11","","","","","36","","Sustain.

In contrast to other works that have mostly focused on the optimal dispatch and economical aspects of VPPs in the hourly and daily time scales, in this paper we focus on the dynamic nature of the system during the faster sub-hourly time scales. The virtual (i.e., software-based) component of a VPP, combined with the power plant (i.e., physics-based) components of the power grid, make VPPs prominent examples of cyber-physical systems, where both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics play critical roles in the stability and transient properties of the system.

Because global warming and climate change are posing serious challenges to our planet, the findings of this study may be valuable in the development of smart grids that can properly predict future weather conditions. In this study, we develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to estimate the energy generated at PV and the energy from the hybrid PV and wind energy systems considering several weather factors.

As per the United States Department of Energy, the contemporary power grid comprises a range of constituents such as information management systems, communication technologies, field devices, and other related components. The optimal functioning of said components yields enhanced power quality, thereby reducing power losses and augmenting the dependability of the power provision. During the operational process, the interdependence of interconnected components can present various challenges, including load forecasting, voltage stability evaluation, and power grid security. The present investigation involves the utilization of an artificial intelligence network (ANN) to facilitate the training and prediction of the nodal voltage level pertaining to the IEEE 4-bus system. Four discrete models have been postulated to authenticate the efficacy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology. The findings indicate that the ensemble of models exhibits superior performance compared to other models in forecasting the nodal voltage stability of the aforementioned electrical system. The ensemble model attains the highest accuracy rate of 98.73%. Additionally, the mean squared error and mean absolute error exhibit the best (lowest) values of 0.0095 and 0.0141, respectively. The outcomes obtained indicate the efficacy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology, particularly in the ensemble configuration, for predicting the voltage stability of the electrical power grid.  © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:17:51","","58994-59001","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O presente estudo envolve a utilização de uma rede neural artificial para facilitar o treinamento e predição do nível de tensão nodal pertencente ao sistema IEEE de 4 barras.

An efficient vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling scheme that can deal with renewable energy volatility and protect vehicle batteries from fast aging is indispensable to enable this benefit. This article develops a novel V2G scheduling method for consuming local renewable energy in microgrids by using a mixed learning framework. It is the first attempt to integrate battery protective targets in GEVs charging management in renewable energy systems. Battery safeguard strategies are derived via an offline soft-run scheduling process, where V2G management is modeled as a constrained optimization problem based on estimated microgrid and GEVs states. Meanwhile, an online V2G regulator is built to facilitate the real-time scheduling of GEVs' charging. The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is used to train the established online regulator by learning rules from soft-run strategies. The online charging coordination of GEVs is realized by the ELM regulator based on real-time sampled microgrid frequency. The effectiveness of the developed models is verified on a U.K. microgrid with actual energy generation and consumption data.

Under this paradigm, microgrids have become autonomous entities that must intelligently determine their policies for energy trading and scheduling. Many factors influence a microgrid’s decision-making, such as the complex microgrid infrastructure, the uncertain energy yield and demand, and the competition among the energy market players. These factors are usually hard to precisely model, and deriving the optimal policy for a microgrid is challenging. We propose a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach with an attention mechanism to learn the optimal policies for the microgrids without complex system modeling. We model each microgrid as an autonomous agent, which learns how to schedule energy resources and trade with others by collaborating with other agents. We adopt attention mechanism to enable intelligently selecting contextual information for the training of each agent. After training, an agent can make control decisions using only its local information, which can well preserve the microgrids’ privacy and reduce the communication overhead among microgrids to facilitate distributed control. We implement a simulation environment and evaluate the performances of our proposed method using real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our method can significantly reduce the cost of the microgrids compared with the baseline methods. © 2022 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:17:51","","10638-10652","","12","34","","IEEE Trans.

It is necessary to measure the parameters of voltage fluctuations and flicker levels to achieve a secure supply of power. However, higher-order harmonics and noises in voltage waveform make such assessment a burdensome task. The traditional techniques fail to provide exact monitoring due to the uncharacteristic variations in the input voltage signal. Nowadays, data-driven methods have become a prominent choice for non-stationary, nonlinear signal analysis as it efficiently tackles atypical changes by its capability to identify spatio-temporal information from given data. The present paper proposes a data-driven hybrid methodology for monitoring voltage fluctuations using the low-rank approximation of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and flat-top finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The low-rank approximation of DMD enables to identify the spatio-temporal coherent structures from the data by mapping the data into a lower-dimensional space. Adaptive flat-top FIR filter tracks the fundamental dynamic phasor by identifying the instantaneous frequency, magnitude and phase variations. The performance of the proposed hybrid methodology is assessed using different test cases, and is compared with various existing approaches. The promising results suggest that the proposed methodology can be used for accurate parameter identification and monitoring voltage fluctuations in smart grid scenarios. It can also be used as an accurate tool in distribution grids to detect higher-order harmonics. © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:17:51","","39228-39242","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe uma metodologia híbrida baseada em dados para monitorar flutuações de tensão usando a aproximação de baixa classificação de decomposição de modo dinâmico (DMD) e filtro de resposta de impulso finito (FIR) de topo plano.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric loads; Power quality; Smart power grids; Renewable energy resources; Smart grid; smart grid; Reactive power; Harmonic analysis; Computational modelling; Fluctuation; Bandpass filters; Dynamic mode decomposition; Dynamic mode decompositions; FIR filters; Flat-top; Flat-top finite impulse response filter; flat-top FIR filter; Hankelization; Impulse response; Power harmonic filters; power quality; voltage fluctuations; Voltage fluctuations; Voltage measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional load frequency control has difficulty overcoming the above problems due to its lack of adaptive control ability and robustness. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a sea computing-based grid-area coordinated load frequency control (SCGAC-LFC) method, which equates each grid unit and area unit in each area as independent agents. Instead of different units relying on different strategies, all units collectively obtain the LFC policy that suits the market requirements. In its online application, no communication is needed since each unit can arrive at its own decision. In addition, this paper proposes a curriculum multiagent deep meta-actor-critic (CMA-DMAC) algorithm, which introduces meta-reinforcement learning and curriculum learning to guide the agent training to improve the robustness and quality of the obtained SCGAC-LFC strategies.

AEVs are sensor-driven and driverless that uses artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactions in Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) ecosystems. AEVs can reduce carbon footprints and trade energy with peer AEVs, smart grids (SG), and roadside units (RSUs). It supports green transportation vision. However, the sensor information, energy units, and user data are exchanged through open channels, and thus, are susceptible to various security and privacy attacks. Thus, AEVs can be remotely operated and directed by malicious entities that can propagate false updates to the peer nodes in IoV environment. This can cause the failure of components, congestion, as well as the entire disruption of IoV network. Globally researchers and security analysts have addressed solutions that pertain to specific security requirements, but still, the detection and classification of malicious AEVs is a widely studied topic. Malicious AEVs exhibit an anomaly behavior that differentiates them from normal AEVs, and thereby, the detection of anomalous AEVs and classification of anomaly type is required. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, the survey presents a systematic outlook of AI techniques in anomaly detection of AEVs. A solution taxonomy is proposed based on research gaps in the existing surveys, and the evaluation metrics for AI-based anomaly detection are discussed. The open challenges and issues in AI deployments are discussed and a case study is presented on anomaly classification through a weighted ensemble technique.

It is characterized by a bidirectional flow of information and energy between consumers and suppliers. However, the rapid increase of energy demands in residential areas is becoming a challenging problem. In order to address this issue, Demand-Side Management (DSM) has proven to be an effective solution. In this paper, we propose LOSISH, a price-based Demand Response (DR) system for load scheduling in residential Smart Homes (SHs) that achieves a trade-off between electricity payments and consumer's discomfort. Our proposed system considers Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV). We formulate our scheduling as a constrained optimization problem and we propose a new hybrid algorithm to solve it. The latter combines two well known heuristic algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). Moreover, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on Machine Learning (ML) to extract consumer's preferences from a real dataset that contains the historical consumption patterns of his smart appliances. We test our approach on real data traces obtained from a SH and we set up an experiment to evaluate our algorithm on a Raspberry Pi and measure its energy consumption. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with another approach from the literature in terms of electricity bill, Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR), energy consumption, and execution time. Numerical results show that LOSISH outperforms the other approach in terms of electricity bill (up to 52.92% cheaper), PAR (up to 44% decrease in peak demands), energy consumption (up to 69.44% less consumption), and execution time (up to 63.15% faster). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:20:52","","","","","323","","Appl.

Finally, the economic analysis shows that the proposed method is a profitable investment, with a breakeven point of thirteen years, due to the very simple implementation and the zero additional cost requested.  © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:19:35","","18673-18688","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O modelo físico do algoritmo é composto por dois elementos principais: os módulos fotovoltaicos e o sistema de armazenamento de energia da bateria.

The proposed work employs a robust Multi Agent System (MAS) technique to achieve efficient and automated control of the hybrid microgrid operation. The hybrid microgrid system incorporates Renewable Energy Sources (RES), a diesel generator, and a battery storage system. The operation of the hybrid microgrid consists of three distinct modes: islanded, transition to grid, and grid-oriented mode. The system's performance is optimized by considering factors like climatic patterns, energy costs, connected source characteristics, and load demand. Different climatic scenarios are assessed for each mode of operation, where the best, extreme sunny, extreme cloudy, and worst climate conditions are considered for islanded mode; sunny and cloudy scenarios are considered for transition to grid mode as well as grid-feed and grid-tied modes are considered for grid-oriented operation of the microgrid. The simulation studies are performed using the MATLAB/Simulink R2021a environment. Furthermore, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is implemented to optimize power allocation within the microgrid and enhance its cost-effectiveness. The optimization results demonstrate efficient utilization of available energy sources along with effective energy management facilitated by the MAS control system.

The design of DCPSs has so far been focused on performance-related, non-functional requirements. However, with the growing power consumption and computation expenses, sustainability is becoming an important aspect to consider. This has led to the concept of energy-aware DCPSs, which integrate conventional non-functional requirements with additional attributes for sustainability, such as energy consumption. This research activity aimed to investigate and develop energy-aware architectural models and edge/cloud computing technologies to design next-generation, AI-enabled (and, specifically, deep-learning-enhanced), self-conscious IoT-extended DCPSs. Our key contributions include energy-aware edge-to-cloud architectural models and technologies, the orchestration of a (possibly federated) edge-to-cloud infrastructure, abstractions and unified models for distributed heterogeneous virtualized resources, innovative machine learning algorithms for the dynamic reallocation and reconfiguration of energy resources, and the management of energy communities. The proposed solution was validated through case studies on optimizing renewable energy communities (RECs), or energy-aware DCPSs, which are particularly challenging due to their unique requirements and constraints; in more detail, in this work, we aim to define the optimal implementation of an energy-aware DCPS. Moreover, smart grids play a crucial role in developing energy-aware DCPSs, providing a flexible and efficient power system integrating renewable energy sources, microgrids, and other distributed energy resources. The proposed energy-aware DCPSs contribute to the development of smart grids by providing a sustainable, self-consistent, and efficient way to manage energy distribution and consumption. The performance demonstrates our approach’s effectiveness for consumption and production (based on RMSE and MAE metrics). Our research supports the transition towards a more sustainable future, where communities adopting REC principles become key players in the energy landscape. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:51","2024-01-24 11:19:20","","","","9","23","","Sensors","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo teve como objetivo investigar e desenvolver modelos arquitetônicos conscientes de energia e tecnologias de computação de ponta/nuvem para projetar DCPSs estendidos de IoT de próxima geração, habilitados para IA (e, especificamente, aprimorados com aprendizado profundo) e autoconscientes.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I2</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Deep learning; Energy management systems; Learning systems; Smart power grids; Energy efficiency; energy management; machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Smart grid; smart grids; energy resource; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Sustainable development; Electric power distribution; Learning algorithms; deep learning; Internet of Things; renewable energy; algorithm; cloud computing; energy consumption; Power management; Cyber Physical System; energy conservation; article; human; Cloud infrastructures; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; edge-to-cloud infrastructure; Edge-to-cloud infrastructure; Energy aware; energy-aware DCPS; Energy-aware distributed cybe-physical system; financial management; Green computing; internet of things; renewable energy communities (RECs); Renewable energy community; CONSUMPTION; MANAGEMENT; PREDICTION; NETWORK; EDGE; MECHANISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, two fundamental constraints exist that preclude widespread adoption: the availability of the generated power and the expense of the equipment. One of the most critical difficulties with this sort of hybrid system is to appropriately design the Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) elements so that they fulfill all load requirements while requiring the least amount of investment and running expenditures. This research proposes a novel technique for evaluating the optimal smart grid linking Hybrid Renewable Energy (Solar photovoltaic and wind) with battery, to increase profitability, dependability, and feasibility. A multiobjective function is suggested and constructed to be optimized utilizing two optimization algorithms: Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm with Fuzzy-Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The primary goal for the HRES is to operate optimally to reduce the cost of energy generat ion through hourly day-ahead. Here, the Fuzzy-ELM is utilized to predict the required load of the smart grid-connected system and hybrid EPSO-HHO, which are introduced to solve the problem of HRES economic analysis. Finally, the suggested EPSO-EHO method is implemented in the MATLAB software, and its performance comparison is made with other existing methods such as PSO, WOA, and HHO. The simulation result shows that the cost of the newly suggested EPSO-HHO technique-based Hybrid Renewable Energy System is less than PSO, WOA, and HHO by 4.89 %, 4.51 %, and 4.05 %, respectively.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

They are capable of operating autonomously when the connection to the main grid is difficult or cost-ineffective.

In this paper, we present the first design and implementation of a microgrid security monitoring platform based on IEC 62351-7:2017 Network and System Management (NSM). The capabilities of this platform are demonstrated on a detailed microgrid model that is deployed on a real-time co-simulation testbed. A hybrid rule-based and machine learning anomaly detection approach is developed to detect attacks targeting the microgrid. To investigate the effectiveness of the NSM security monitoring platform, evaluate the proposed detection schemes, and observe the impact of cyberattacks on the microgrid operation, several formulated attacks against the microgrid are simulated. The effectiveness of different parameters and architectures for the anomaly detection schemes are compared against one another, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

To perform this analysis, a two-stage process is proposed: first, a Monte-Carlo simulation-based stochastic approach is adopted to generate samples to simulate intermittent loads, power generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), and fault occurs in the upstream grid; second, for each sample indicating islanded mode, a grid-connected daily Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is formulated in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) form based on minimizing operation cost to withdraw the State of the Charge (SoC) of stationery and traction batteries and electrical vehicles before microgrids may go to islanded mode. Finally, resilience of islanded microgrids are evaluated through some indices. In addition, different strategies are considered for modeling the behavior of both two types of electrical vehicles V1G and V2G.

However, current distributionally robust energy management models suffer from convergence inefficiencies when exposed to large amounts of historical data, and typically neglect the multi-period coupling effect of EV user behaviors, which hinder the effective utilization of the highly-potential EV resources. In this paper, a novel distributionally robust energy management model for MMGs is proposed to accommodate the uncertainties of RESs and loads, with the grid-interactive EVs operating in an efficient vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode. Firstly, a multi-period dynamic EV-connection matrix is formulated to determine the connection and dwell times for EVs interacting with the power systems, which enables the cross-cycle continuity of SOCs. Further, the multi-period coupling uncertainties of accidental EVs disconnections are taken into account. Secondly, the Kohonen neural network-based ambiguity set is constructed without including the entire historical scenarios, where the ambiguous distribution is characterized by the representative scenarios with weights. On this basis, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model is finally developed, which can be solved iteratively by the extended column-and-constraint generation method until the worst-case cost expectation is obtained. The proposed model was evaluated through simulations on a system comprising four interconnected microgrids from the Hainan provincial power grid. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior cost efficiency, convergence performance and robustness compared to alternative approaches. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:17:52","","","","","350","","Appl.

Alternative assets, including storage and control systems, are required to fill the gap and maintain the system stable, but all contributions should be previously analysed and studied by means of energy models. However, the modelling of operational constraints such as reserve requirements leads to increased computational burden, especially when employing long-term planning methods with unit-commitment needs. Therefore, planning tools often approximate or neglect reserve needs, leading to major sizing errors. This paper presents a novel model and policy recommendations for integrating short-term aspects and power reserve requirements in the planning of off-grid microgrids. The developed framework includes the formulation of an accurate cost and unit commitment model for fuel-fired generators, the formalisation of power reserve requirements and the representation of the contribution of storage and non-dispatchable technologies to power reserve. The mathematical formulation of the different assets is explored, also investigating the mutual influence of the modeled phenomena. The approach is implemented on a Mediterranean non-interconnected island. The results show acceptable trade-off between computation time and accuracy in one-year hourly simulations. Evidence demonstrates that ignoring the reserve requirements may lead to a 30% misjudgment of costs and an underestimation of the necessary reserve requirements. Enabling storage to provide reserve significantly reduces overall system costs (up to -20%), decreases fuel consumption (-35%), and improves resilience, hence suggesting the pivotal role of storage in providing reserve.  © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:17:52","","100781-100797","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta um novo modelo e recomendações políticas para integrar aspectos de curto prazo e requisitos de reserva de energia no planejamento de microrredes fora da rede.

Microgrids appear to be the solution for large-scale renewable energy integration in these sectors. The microgrid components must be optimally planned and operated to prevent high costs, technical issues, and emissions. Existing approaches for optimal microgrid planning and operation in the literature do not include a solution for e-mobility infrastructure development. Consequently, the authors provide a compact new methodology that considers the placement and the stochastic evolution of e-mobility infrastructure. In this new methodology, a retropolation approach to forecast the rise in the number of electric vehicles, a monte-carlo simulation for electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviors, a method for the definition of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) numbers based on occupancy time, and public EVCS placement based on monte-carlo simulation have been developed. A deterministic optimization strategy for the planning and operation of microgrids is created using the abovementioned methodologies, which additionally consider technical power system issues. As the future development of e-mobility infrastructure has high associated uncertainties, a new stochastic method referred to as the information gap decision method (IGDM) is proposed. This method provides a risk-averse strategy for microgrid planning and operation by including long-term uncertainty related to e-mobility. Finally, the deterministic and stochastic methodologies are combined in a novel holistic approach for microgrid design and operation in terms of cost, emission, and robustness. The proposed method has been tested in a new settlement area in Magdeburg, Germany, under three different EV development scenarios (negative, trend, and positive). EVs are expected to reach 31 percent of the total number of cars in the investigated settlement area. Due to this, three public electric vehicle charging stations will be required in the 2031 trend scenario. Thus, the investigated settlement area requires a total cost of 127,029 €. In association with possible uncertainties, the cost of the microgrid must be raised by 80 percent to gain complete robustness against long-term risks in the development of EVCS. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:17:52","","","","","34","","Sustain.

As the concept of the electricity market is picking up, these highly intermittent solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) power plants are being connected to the grid in the form of MG which has the option of storage as well. The PV and WT power generations may vary from the forecasted generations, which leads to unreliable bidding offers in the electricity market through the bidding process. Further, leads to revenue loss due to penalties imposed for violating the agreements. They can participate in the electricity markets reliably if the MG has a properly sized storage system, which takes care of the deviations in generation for optimal, efficient, and reliable bidding. In this paper, a mathematical model for an optimal bidding strategy of power producers is proposed for a low voltage grid-connected microgrid (GCMG) system operating in a day-ahead electricity market having a pump storage (PS) unit as risk managing storage device. The uncertainties of PV and WT power plants are modeled through Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) based Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). The system performance has been investigated for three-generation scenarios of the renewable power generations. A penalty has been imposed on utilities for violating the committed power schedule in the day-ahead market based on the forecasted power generation. The optimal size of the storage system will help in avoiding the penalties imposed for deviations from the commitments. The optimum size of the PS unit has been obtained for the optimal bidding and minimizing the operational cost of the system. The results show that an appropriately sized PS unit is the best energy storage system to deal with the uncertainties of the DESs and reduce the operation cost up to 11.33–13.68% depending upon the operational constraints. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:17:52","","","","","51","","J.

Traditionally, the primary source of electricity on the islands has been imported diesel fuel, with high financial costs for most utilities. In this context, even replacing part of the traditional production with renewable energy source can reduce costs and improve the quality of life of islanders. However, integrating large amounts of renewable energy production into existing grids introduces many concerns regarding feasibility, economic analysis, and technical implementation. From this point of view, machine learning and deep learning techniques are efficient tools to mitigate these problems. Their potential results are beneficial considering isolated grids of small islands which are not connected to the national grid. In this paper, a study of the Italian island of Ponza is carried out. The isolation leads to several challenges, such as the high cost related to the transport, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy sources in a small area with several constraints and their intermittent power production, which requires the use of storage systems for dispatching purposes. The proposed study aims to identify future developments of the electricity grid by considering the deployment of both renewable energy sources and energy storage systems.

In smart grid, there is a increase in the penetration level of solar PV and wind power generation. The solar radiation received at the earth surface is greatly dependent on various atmospheric parameters. Forecasting of solar radiation and photovoltaic power is a major concern in terms of efficient integration of solar PV plants in the power grid. There are significant challenges in smart grid energy management due to the variability of large-scale renewable energy generation. Renewable energy forecasting is critical to reduce the uncertainty related to renewable energy generation for a wide range of planning, investment and decision-making purposes. As renewable energy sources are highly intermittent and variable, all the forecasting models available in the literature contain errors. This paper presents an overview of current and new development of weather forecasting such as solar and wind forecasting techniques for renewable energy system in smart grid.

However, the smart grid is more vulnerable to cyberattacks than its traditional counterpart, especially the false data injection attack (FDIA), which aims to add false data into the transmitted signals to cause undesirable behavior. This article proposes a new scheme to detect and estimate the FDIA on load frequency control (LFC) of modern interconnected power systems considering renewable energy sources (RESs) and high voltage direct current (HVDC) link. The proposed scheme is based on the Kalman filter (KF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The KF is used to detect the FDIA in the transmitted system signals and indicates the possibility of an attack in each transmitted signal, where the role of ANNs is to estimate the transmitted signal before attacking. Hence, based on KF and ANNs, the proposed scheme can ensure the detection of false data and remove the attack simultaneously. The proposed cyber-security scheme is considered a thorough solution that can effectively reduce the impact of the FDIA on any of the four transmitted signals within the two-area interconnected power system, all while simulating the virtual inertia control strategy. The simulation results of the studied low-inertia interconnected power system are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink® software. The simulation results successfully demonstrate the proposed scheme's efficacy, accuracy, and acceptability to detect and eliminate the FDIA on the LFC of low-inertia interconnected power grids. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:19:25","","","","","425","","J.

It is based on a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS), aiming to minimize the operation cost of a microgrid comprising a group of buildings, renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The optimization problem is suitably set up to ensure low computation requirements and it is solved with particle swarm optimization (PSO). Optimal operation scheduling for grid-connected and autonomous operation of microgrids of building prosumers, considering their thermal and electrical systems, integrated RES, conventional and dynamic ESS is proposed. The models used are not computationally demanding, allowing the application to complex systems and they are not being limited to one building scale which is the case for the majority of relative research. Another innovative feature of the proposed algorithm, among others, is that it ensures autonomous operation at certain time periods without the use of any emergency generator sets. Detailed simulation results of different operation scenarios, showed that cost savings in range of 11% can be achieved while a large number of operation and technical constraints are satisfactorily met in grid-connected and autonomous operation. © 2021","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:17:52","","","","","198","","Electr Power Syst Res","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe um sistema de gerenciamento de energia para microrredes de prossumidores de construção.

The renewable energy output forecasting applications have also been developing rapidly in recent years, and such techniques have particularly been applied in the fields of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV). In the case of solar PV output forecasting, many applications have been performed with machine learning and hybrid techniques. In this paper, we propose a high-precision deep neural network model named PVPNet to forecast PV system output power. The methodology behind the proposed model is based on deep neural networks, and the model is able to generate a 24-h probabilistic and deterministic forecasting of PV power output based on meteorological information, such as temperature, solar radiation, and historical PV system output data. The forecasting accuracy of PVPNet is determined by the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. The results from the experiments show that the MAE and RMSE of the proposed algorithm are 109.4845 and 163.1513, respectively.

Forecasting daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual data for different locations with varying observation/data samples remains challenging with a single forecasting algorithm. We presented the ensemble-based k-nearest neighbor algorithm for wind and solar power forecasting in this study to respond to the challenges mentioned above. The included k-NNC deep architecture provides nonlinear modeling complexity in solar and wind energy, enabling a more precise estimate of spatial solar and wind energy patterns. Makowski metric analysis was employed to train and optimize the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The chi-square distance was used to theoretically assess the goodness of fit of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm between expected and observed values. The 5-fold cross-validation method was utilized to estimate the accurate lasso-penalty strength for high-dimensional solar/wind data. The ensemble forecasts were combined using 5-fold cross-validation to improve generalization performance, minimizing over-fitting induced by base model correlation. For daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual solar and wind power forecasting, two different climate areas and four distinct experimental setups are presented. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed k-nearest neighbor technique is validated using three performance assessment indices and four existing forecasting models. The mean absolute error of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm generalized linear regression model, one-step-secant backpropagation neural network, decision tree, and BFGS Quasi-Newton backpropagation neural network for solar and wind power forecasting was measured at 1.16, 5.59, 4.22, 1.70, 3.23, and 8.60, 15.81, 40.64, 0.56, and 15.04, respectively. Utilities can anticipate down- and up-ramps in variable renewable energy generation by introducing the k-nearest neighbor algorithm into power system operations, allowing them to cost-effectively balance renewable energy production and load on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual basis. This will improve power system dependability, reduce fuel costs, and limit the use of solar and wind resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:52","2024-01-24 11:17:52","","","","","75","","Sustainable Cities Soc.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Clusterização</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>Apresentamos o algoritmo k-vizinho mais próximo baseado em conjunto para previsão de energia eólica e solar neste estudo para responder aos desafios mencionados acima.

A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model. © 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The probability density functions of the solar and wind power outputs, as well as the demand of the households, have been used to determine the amount of uncertainty and to plan various scenarios. We also used a particle swarm optimization algorithm for the microgrid energy management and compared the optimization results obtained from the two algorithms. The simulation results show that uncertainty in the microgrid normally has a significant effect on the outcomes, and failure to consider it would lead to inaccurate management methods. Moreover, the results confirm the excellent performance of the proposed approach. © 2019 by the authors.

With scattered renewable energy resources and loads, multi-agent systems are a viable tool for controlling and improving the operation of microgrids. They are autonomous systems, where agents interact together to optimize decisions and reach system objectives. This paper presents an overview of multi-agent systems for microgrid control and management. It discusses design elements and performance issues, whereby various performance indicators and optimization algorithms are summarized and compared in terms of convergence time and performance in achieving system objectives. It is found that Particle Swarm Optimization has a good convergence time, so it is combined with other algorithms to address optimization issues in microgrids. Further, information diffusion and consensus algorithms are explored, and according to the literature, many variants of average-consensus algorithm are used to asynchronously reach an equilibrium.

Demands for ML techniques in the energy sectors will increase considerably in the coming years, since there is a growing demand of academic programmes related to artificial intelligence in science, math, and engineering. Data generation, management, and safety are expected to play a key role for the successful implementation of ML algorithms that can be shared by major stakeholders in the energy sector, thereby promoting the development of ambitious energy management projects.

An efficient energy management and electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new Robust Data Predictive Control framework for Energy Management System (RDPC-EMS) is developed to overcome the uncertainty of the electricity retail price market and minimize the total operating costs for the multi-microgrids (MMG) system. The proposed framework solves the economic energy dispatch based on an accurate Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) by an Outlier-Robust Extreme Learning Machine (OR-ELM) algorithm and a two layers cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC). The First level provides an optimal energy scheduling between the Distribution System Operator (DSO) and cooperative microgrids systems to minimize the operating cost based on the forecasted electricity price. In contrast, second level maintains the supply-demand balance by applying the optimal energy scheduling from the first layer through an adjustment of the distributed energy resources (DER). The electricity retail price prediction is assessed using real dataset from the Iso New England electricity market. The OR-ELM regression method shows a significant forecasting performance in terms of error metrics. For instance, the mean absolute error in the training stage 2.05% for OR-ELM with a comparison of 4.17% and 6.29% for Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models respectively.

Local generation, energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources can form load service entities, which can provide ancillary services to the utility grid and to consumers. On the other hand, microgrids can also sell energy to load service entities or the utility grid to obtain profits. But how the load service entities can decide the electricity selling price to multiple microgrids, and how the microgrids can decide the electricity selling price to load service entities are problems. In this paper, we present a price decision method for multiple microgrids considering demand response. Mixed integer linear programming is used to control the operation of each microgrid, and is also used to operate the load service entities. A genetic algorithm is used to search for the best price for each microgrid and the load service entities. The combined method is deployed in a decentralized way, namely, each microgrid runs its own operation problem. The simulation results show that the new searched price works better than a basic time of use price, which can reduce the operation cost of the whole system. The searching method is compared with a method based on the Cournot model. At last, a large system is tested, in which 4 load service entities, 16 microgrids and an IEEE30-node network are considered. In order to reduce the searching time, a neural network model is presented to estimate the operation of the whole system. Based on the neural network model, the prices are obtained, and the results show that the prices based on neural network model are better than with the time of use price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","117-135","","","167","","Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta algoritmo genético utilizado para buscar o melhor preço para cada microrrede e entidades prestadoras de serviço de cargaum método de decisão de preços para múltiplas microrredes considerando a resposta à demanda com base no modelo de rede neural.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Costs; Electric energy storage; Renewable energy source; Sales; Smart power grids; Renewable energy resources; Microgrids; Optimization; alternative energy; energy resource; optimization; artificial neural network; Neural networks; Genetic algorithms; electricity supply; hydrogen; Multi-energy systems; Integer programming; Demand response; energy storage; profitability; Neural network; simulation; demand analysis; Energy storage systems; Data storage equipment; genetic algorithm; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage system; linear programing; Load service entities; Mixed integer linear programming; Multi-energy-system; Price; price determination; Storage as a service (STaaS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the literature, most EMSs proposed are based on the implementation of energy systems prediction which enable to run a specific optimization algorithm. Such strategy, known as Rolling Time Horizon (RTH), demonstrated very effective when the supporting prediction system performs well. However, it is featured by high operational times. In this work, different lightweight EMS models synthesized through machine learning algorithms have been compared considering six different simulation scenarios. Results shows that an RTH-based EMS owns the best overall performances. However, in some case studies, also other EMSs show competitive results, especially those based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) trained by clustering, which in one case outperform RTH EMSs, and in other 3 cases (out of 6) yields performances close to RTH EMSs within 5%. A second contribution concerns the RTH EMS implementation on a small micro-controller, highlighting the high computational effort which can range in the order of minutes. Conversely, the ANFIS EMS shows always almost negligible computational costs (less than one second) and therefore can be used in realistic scenarios on cheap devices at run time. The paper also proposed a novel graphic tool to better represent, observe and analyze microgrid energy flows in each time slot or along the overall considered dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:21:07","","","","","277","","Appl.

Phase-one is a pre-auction phase that defines the maximum charging and discharging BESS power limits. These limits guarantee a reliable distribution system operation without violating the buses' voltage limits or the ampacity of the branches. Phase-two is an auctioning phase between the BESSagents and the RES-agents. Each agent has a different owner with a specific profit agenda and risk levels. The agent tries to maximize the profit potential of the owner. The agents use historical trade data and expected weather conditions to maximize profitability.

According to the upstream electricity grid conditions, microgrid can operate in grid-connected and islanded modes. Energy storage systems play a critical role in maintaining the frequency and voltage stability of an islanded microgrid. As a result, several energy management systems techniques have been proposed. This paper introduces a microgrid system, an overview of local control in a microgrid, and an efficient EMS for effective microgrid operations using three smart controllers for optimal microgrid stability. We designed a microgrid consisting of renewable sources, Li-ion batteries, the main grid as a backup system, and AC/DC loads. The proposed system control was based on supplying loads as efficiently as possible using renewable energy sources and monitoring the battery’s state of charge. The simulation results using MATLAB Simulink demonstrate the performance of the three proposed microgrid stability strategies (PID, artificial neural network, and fuzzy logic).

Firstly, a multi-agent based microgrid and home energy management system is constructed. Subsequently, system models for renewable energy sources, electrical vehicles, residential loads and the cost function are constructed to form the microgrid operation constraints. With these constraints, three optimization models are proposed to minimize the electricity bills, the power purchased from the main grid, and optimize the power quality. The three objectives are proposed to reflect the power consumer's needs for cost saving, green consumption, and power reliability, respectively. Meanwhile, a coordination strategy which balances the three objectives is proposed. After that, a novel multi agent system is proposed to realize the proposed objectives. Four case studies and a sensitivity analysis are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The case study results show that: in electricity minimization, 2–6.5% of total electricity bills can be saved; in main grid power consumption minimization, the peaks of the power consumption profiles are shaved while the valleys of the profiles are filled; in power quality enhancement, the steady state frequency drop is reduced for 0.35 Hz to 0.38 Hz. The sensitivity analysis shows that communities equipped with energy storage systems accounting for 30% of the total load can achieve best optimization outcomes; the increase in renewable energy usage will lead to higher electricity bills and poorer power quality if the renewable energy sources are limited, while the availability of more renewable energy sources will compensate for the negative effects of using renewable energy sources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","","","","259","","Appl.

In this paper, a multi-agent-based decentralised relaxed-constrained energy management strategy for a community-based residential microgrid system using demand-side management is presented. The proposed demand-side management system controls the creative decision-making process of the residential customer agents interconnected within the proposed residential microgrid system. The main objectives of the proposed demand-side management controllers are to make decisions that reduce the peak demand of the load to each agent and to reshape the profile of the power load based on their energy consumption pattern. In addition to this, the novel realistic appliance models with discrete operational levels and on–off capabilities proposed in this research makes the optimisation process a non-convex mixed-integer problem. The proposed decentralised optimisation scheme addressed this issue, by initially relaxing the constraints on the appliances and then using the gradient descent algorithm to decompose and solve the realistic schedules for the devices in the scheduling period. Results indicated that the proposed decentralised relaxed constrain approach is more feasible, effective, economical and efficient in addressing the energy management problem of a residential community microgrid. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","","","","277","","Appl.

When ES modifies the conventional methods of operation where the generated energy differs from the load energy, the new operational strategy where the load energy changes with the generation energy changes will be realized. Future sustainable microgrids (MGs) require essential components like solar and wind-generated electricity. The power imbalance between the generating side and the load side will be caused by RESs' intermittency, instability, and lack of prediction accuracy, among other traits. Additionally, both the grid's security and the caliber of the power being delivered will be impacted. This paper presents an effective idea known as the Electrical Spring for controlling mains voltage despite variations brought on by intermittent renewable energy sources in the DC microgrid setting. In this study, a DC-DC converter is equipped with a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to be able to examine power quality problems like, voltage ripple and voltage regulation. The MATLAB is used to run the simulation in the Simulink environment. The results of the artificial neural network (ANN)-based intelligent controller, Model Predictive Controller (MPC) and the conventional PI controller are compared with the performance parameters that the proposed FLC controller has obtained. A study based on Matlab simulation results is conducted and published to support the effectiveness and accuracy of the suggested control strategy. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

Among these challenges, spinning reserve energy management should be accurately considered in the microgrid scheduling system for a better system operation. This study presents a methodology to model and analyse a novel scheme to integrate RESs, particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in diesel generation-based isolated microgrids. The proposed approach considers the uncertainties of PV power generation and demand, simultaneously, by solving a bi-level multi-objective optimisation problem using information gap decision theory (IGDT). The proposed energy management system is formulated considering spinning reserve constraints and the uncertainties associated with PV power generation and load, by solving a unit commitment problem. This method, a non-probabilistic approach, does not require the probability density function of uncertain parameters and provides a robust framework to better understand the potential savings due to the PV integration. In order to test and perform the analysis, realistic data from a 20 MW hybrid PV project is used as a case study. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with probabilistic techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations and scenario-based stochastic programming technique. The presented studies demonstrate applicability of the proposed model for real microgrids. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Main challenges associated with operating such a system stems primarily from the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable energy sources causing the energy generation to be highly irregular and less predictable. Multi-microgrid (MMG) systems with flexibility to trade energy between individual MGs can alleviate the demand–supply mismatch problem, but its design and operation become more complicated. Previous studies on MMGs addressed only the case where all the MGs are fully connected to share electricity. However, the installation of electric cable connections over the full network can be costly and is often unjustified. To address the question of how to best achieve a tradeoff, this work proposes the use of a two-stage stochastic decision-making approach for designing and operating an MMG considering both the capital cost for installing the electric cables and operating cost. First, real weather data are used to develop stochastic models that describe the uncertain, intermittent nature of energy production through renewable sources over a day. Then, in the first stage, design-level decisions regarding the installation of the electric cable between individual pairs of the MGs are to be determined to achieve the best tradeoff for the modeled system and weather pattern. In the second stage, the optimal energy dispatch planning for each individual MG including the energy trading between the MGs is carried out based on a particular realized scenario of the renewable energy production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","","","","291","","Appl.

The distributed artificial intelligence technology based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) is adopted to independently control the 150 EWHs using a virtual tariff. Two different strategies are proposed to generate the virtual tariff and they are compared to each other to investigate the impact of communication time-delay to the proposed RL algorithm in real-time control scenario. The first strategy is based on measuring the battery State of Charge (SOC) in real time while the second method is based on predicting the SOC 24-hours in advance using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results show that the communication time-delay greatly influences the convergence result of the first method while the second method showed high immunity.

Using this novel hybrid technique, the MSE, RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and R are 14.9721, 3.8693, 3.32%, 0.867, and 0.9984, respectively. These obtained results show that the novel hybrid model outperforms other models in the literature and can be helpful for future renewable energy requirements. However, the convergence speed of the proposed approach can be affected due to the random variability of available data.  © 2022 Alexandre Teplaira Boum et al.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","","","","2022","","Comput.

With the penetration of renewable energy sources in microgrids, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm based on consensus theory to solve the EDP with a quadratic cost function. The method takes advantage of the fact that incremental costs need to be equal for all buses at optimal output power values. Thus, the incremental cost of each bus is selected as a consensus variable and the local mismatch between total demand and generation is assigned as a feedback variable to meet demand constraints. Unlike the existing related works, the feedback gains for the feedback variables are different and time-varying. Using multi-parameter perturbation theory and graph theory, the convergence of the algorithm is proved. Furthermore, the upper bounds of the feedback gains are given theoretically, and we obtain that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a rate governed by the second largest eigenvalue of the system matrix. Meanwhile, the algorithm is a fully distributed algorithm without a leader or a virtual command node. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm even though there is a demand change and generator damage. Some simulation results intuitively illustrate how the convergence speed changes with the feedback gains. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","2019","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","3630-3640","","4","10","","IEEE Trans.

Accordingly, in this article, a precise forecasting method based on a deep learning concept with microclustering (MC) task is presented. The MC method is structured based on hybrid unsupervised and supervised clustering tasks by K-means and Gaussian support vector machine, respectively. In the proposed method, the input data sequence is clustered by the MC task, and then the forecasting process is employed. By applying the MC, input data in each hour are categorized into different groups, and a distinctive forecasting unit is allocated to each one. In this way, more clusters and forecasting networks are earmarked for the hours with higher fluctuation rates. The bi-directional long short-term memory (B-LSTM), which is one of the newest recurrent artificial neural networks, is proposed as the forecasting unit. The B-LSTM has bidirectional memory - feedforward and feedback loops - that helps us to investigate both previous and future hidden layers data. The optimal number of clusters in each hour is determined based on the Davies-Bouldin index. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, in this study, three forecasting tasks including the wind speed, load demand, and electricity price are studied in different periods using the Ontario province, Canada, data set. The results are compared with other benchmarking methods to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. In fact, the proposed method, which is equipped with the MC technique and B-LSTM networks, significantly promotes the forecasting results, especially in spike points. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:20:08","","8298-8309","","9","68","","IEEE Trans Ind Electron","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Clusterização</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta um método preciso de previsão baseado em um conceito de aprendizagem profunda com tarefa de microclustering com base em tarefas de agrupamento híbridas não supervisionadas e supervisionadas por K-means e máquina de vetores de suporte gaussiana, respectivamente.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Deep learning; Renewable energy source; Smart power grids; Renewable energy resources; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; deep learning; Long short-term memory; Support vector machines; uncertainty; K-means clustering; Electricity prices; Electric load forecasting; forecasting; classification; Uncertainty modeling; Benchmarking methods; Bidirectional long short-term memory (B-LSTM); Davies-Bouldin index; Forecasting methods; Input output programs; Recurrent artificial neural networks; Supervised clustering; POWER; ACCURACY; IDENTIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fulfillment of advanced functionalities in the smart grid firmly relies on the underlying information and communication infrastructure, and the efficient handling of a massive amount of data generated from various sources, e.g., smart meters, phasor measurement units, and various forms of sensors. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of over 200 recent publications is conducted to review the state-of-the-art practices and proposals of machine learning techniques and discuss the trend in a wide range of smart grid application domains.

Due to the intermittence of renewable energy sources, storage systems are necessary, and they are generally used as a backup system. Indeed, to manage the power flows along the entire microgrid, an energy management strategy (EMS) is nec-essary. This paper describes a microgrid energy management system, which is composed of solar panels and wind turbines as renewable sources, Li-ion batteries, electrical grids as backup sources, and AC/DC loads. The proposed EMS is based on the maximum extraction of energy from the renewable sources, by making them operate under Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mode; both of those MPPT algorithms are implemented with a multi-agent system (MAS). In addition, management of the stored energy is performed through the optimal control of battery charging and discharging using artificial neural network controllers (ANNCs). The main objective of this system is to maintain the power balance in the microgrid and to provide a configurable and a flexible control for the different scenarios of all kinds of variations. All the system’s components were modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, the MAS system was developed using Java Agent Development Framework (JADE), and Multi-Agent Control using Simulink with Jade extension (MACSIMJX) was used to insure the communication between Simulink and JADE. © 2021 by the authors.

The microgrid can be assumed as the ideal way to integrate a renewable energy source in the production of electricity and give the consumer the opportunity to participate in the electricity market not just like a consumer but also like a producer. In this paper, we present a multi-agent system based on wind and photovoltaic power prediction using the extreme learning machine algorithm. This algorithm was tested on real weather data taken from the region of Tetouan City in Morocco. The process aimed to implement a microgrid located in Tetouan City and composed of different generation units (solar and wind energies were combined together to increase the efficiency of the system) and storage units (batteries were used to ensure the availability of power on demand as much as possible). In the proposed architecture, the microgrid can exchange electricity with the main grid; therefore, it can buy or sell electricity. Thus, the goal of our multi-agent system is to control the amount of power delivered or taken from the main grid in order to reduce the cost and maximize the benefit. To address uncertainties in the system, we use fuzzy logic control to manage the flow of energy, to ensure the availability of power on demand, and to make a reasonable decision about storing or selling electricity. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","877-893","","1","29","","J Intell Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: De Gruyter Open Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta um sistema multiagente baseado na previsão de energia eólica e fotovoltaica usando o algoritmo Extreme Learning Machine para controlar a quantidade de energia entregue ou retirada da rede principal.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric power system control; Multi agent systems; Renewable energy source; Digital storage; Machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Microgrids; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Intelligent agents; Learning algorithms; Renewable energy; prediction; multi-agent system; Renewable energies; microgrid; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Extreme learning machine; Knowledge acquisition; Micro grid; Photovoltaic cells; Solar and wind energies; Intelligent energy management; extreme learning machine; Fuzzy control; fuzzy logic control; Fuzzy logic control; Proposed architectures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In traditional energy management system (EMS), battery energy storage system (BESS) is only considered in a single microgrid (MG) optimization model, which leads to underutilization of storage devices and waste of resources. Considering the advantages of local consumption of RES, this paper develops a hierarchical multi-agent energy management strategy. A two-step model aiming at maximizing the usage of RES is established to help determine the strategy. In the first step, the strategy is developed to maximize the local consumption of RES based on the demand response programs (DRP) and BESS within the independent MG. In the second step, the community BESS and BESSs are used to share the RES of multiple MGs for increasing the utilization ratio of RES. Simultaneously, the output of each controllable distributed generator (CDG) and the transaction with power grid are determined through a distributed adjustable power generation plan query library (DGPS). Moreover, the simulation with a three-MG system proves that the strategy can effectively increase the utilization ratio of RES and reduce the transaction with power grid compared to the traditional strategy. © 2013 IEEE.","2019","2024-01-24 11:17:53","2024-01-24 11:17:53","","169931-169945","","","7","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo desenvolveu uma estratégia hierárquica de gestão de energia multiagente.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric power system control; Energy management systems; Multi agent systems; Renewable energy source; Energy management; Renewable energy resources; Demand response programs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Battery energy storage systems; Multi micro-grids; energy management system; Virtual storage; Mixed integer linear programming; Energy management strategies; mixed integer linear programming; Multi agent energy management; multi-microgrids; multiagent system; Renewable energy consumption; Waste management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through this article, the current state of the Moroccan network will be studied, as well as its potential in terms of renewable energy.

A multi-agent control system to facilitate information exchange for a microgrid participating in the deregulated framework of the electricity market is proposed. A novel energy management system, aimed at the effective utilization of RES and stored energy in PHESS in order to ensure maximum priority based social benefit to the microgrid controller is presented. The intermittent nature of RES which might cause uncertainties in availability during real-time dispatch, is effectively dealt in the proposed dual layer control approach, through optimal usage of PHESS and employment of load prioritization technique in the proposed renewable microgrid. Thus, the research carried out in this work not only ensures the committed power exchange is maintained constant in both DASL and RTDL, but also contributes significantly in PBSB maximization of the microgrid, while managing real-time uncertainties in RES availability. The importance of pre-prioritizing the loads is put forth, in order to ensure that, if load curtailing needs to be done during peak demand intervals, the critical loads must not suffer.

Increasing fossil-fuel-based electricity generation has serious impacts on environment. As a result, interest in renewable resources has risen, as they are environmentally friendly and may prove to be economical in the long run. However, the intermittent character of renewable energy sources is a major disadvantage. It is important to integrate them with the rest of the grid so that their benefits can be reaped while their negative impacts can be mitigated. In this article, an energy management algorithm is recommended for a grid-connected microgrid consisting of loads, a photovoltaic (PV) system and a battery for efficient use of energy. A model predictive control-inspired approach for energy management is developed using the PV power and consumption estimation obtained from daylight solar irradiation and temperature estimation of the same area. An energy management algorithm, which is based on a neuro-fuzzy inference system, is designed by determining the possible operating states of the system.

By implementing different renewable energy sources, like photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, RMGs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance proficiency. The paper suggests a RMG energy management method based on machine learning, which considers a reconfigurable frame according to the remote link switching and segmentation. The proposed scheme investigates advanced support vector machines to model and estimates the charging demand (ChD) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). To reduce the load impact of HEV on the network, 2 various cases have been implemented; one is coordinated, and the other is smartly charged. Because of the complex construction of the problem statement, an improved optimization technique according to the gray wolf is proposed. The simulation outcomes of the IEEE microgrid (MG) trial system depict that it is of adequate and efficient quality in both cases. Based on the result of the forecast for the total charge demand of HEVs, the average absolute percentage error is 0.978 that is so small.

Nevertheless, the transience of most renewable energy sources (RESs) exacerbates the power quality of the grid network. Furthermore, the unpredictability of RESs additionally becomes challenging in case of high magnitude disturbances. The deployment and optimal utilization of energy storage systems, to act as an energy buffer are hence pertinent. In this paper, a control strategy for a battery energy storage system (BESS) is formulated based on two intelligent decoupled controllers. The objective is the restoration of system voltage and frequency considering a wide range of disturbances and hence circumvent the power quality degradation. The proposed controller is based on hybrid differential evolution optimization and artificial neural network (DEO-ANN). The controller parameters are tuned online by training the ANN with the sets of input and output data obtained during the process of optimizing the two controllers under low and high disturbances using DEO. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated on a power network consisting of a synchronous generator, photovoltaic power system, and BESS.

A key challenge for adopting these energy sources is their high integration costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and data-intensive technologies are already used in different parts of the electricity value chain and, due to the growing complexity and data generation potential of the future smart grid, have the potential to create significant value in the system. However, different uncertainties or lack of understanding about its impact often hinder the commitment of decision makers to invest in AI and data intensive technologies, also in the energy sector. While previous work has outlined a number of ways AI solutions can be used in the power sector, the goal of this article is to consider the value creation potential of AI in terms of managing VRE integration costs.

Different from the existing studies, this paper aims to design an RTP strategy for the smart grid which integrates multi-energy generation on the supply side. Without loss of generality, small-scale distributed energy generation and power storage devices for users are also considered. Taking the interests of both supply and demand sides into consideration, a bilevel stochastic model for real-time demand response in the framework of Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated. The model well captures the interactive characters of both sides. Regarding the difficulty of collecting exact information from users in a centralized way in practice, a novel distributed online multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve the MDP model without acquisition of the transition probabilities. Through the information interaction between the upper and lower levels, the real-time electricity prices are decided adaptively, meanwhile, the optimal strategy of power supply and consumption is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pricing method and algorithm have a good performance in cutting peak and filling the valley and guarantee the benefits of both supply and demand. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:54","2024-01-24 11:17:54","","","","","239","","Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo apresenta um modelo estocástico de dois níveis para resposta à procura em tempo real no âmbito do processo de decisão de Markov (MDP). </p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Costs; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Smart power grids; Renewable energy resources; Smart grid; alternative energy; power generation; smart grid; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Stochastic systems; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; electricity supply; Multi energy; Stochastic models; algorithm; numerical model; Energy generations; Virtual storage; Bi-level programming; Bilevel programming; Generation systems; Markov chain; Markov decision process; Markov Decision Processes; Multi-energy generation; Pricing models; real time; Real time pricing; Real-time pricing; Stochastics; Supply sides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, the multi-agent-system-based bidding system is constructed as bi-level MAS. Then, the bidding model is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, which makes the best of renewable energy source, and subjects it to the object of obtaining maximum profits for all power producers. According to this model, electricity market is divided into two subsidiary markets, which involve the upper and the lower electricity market. The lower electricity market is composed of microgrids, which ally together in the upper electricity market to offset their shortages compared to traditional power producers, such as efficient market influence, the reliability of the energy supplying. Additionally, game theory is introduced for modeling and Nash equilibrium as the solution of bidding optimization problem is found through a series of iterative process based on the bi-level MAS.

These models contemplate sublevels that consider the energetic, automation and computational aspects in the microgrids and a multi-agent system (MAS) that is used to study the environmental and economic impact of the microgrid through the evolution of certain indicators. The socio-technological interdependence in the operation of the isolated microgrid is analyzed through the integration of the microgrid emulation platform with the MAS. Our approach includes a comprehensive study of the performance of these projects in specific communities, in order to contribute to the design and implementation, considering the technological, economic, environmental, and social impacts. © 2021 by the authors.

Integration of a multi-microgrid network with the main grid acts as a major boost to the overall reliability of the power system. A novel energy management system approach is proposed in this work which exhaustively caters to all possible situations which may arise in a grid-connected multi-microgrid network during the scheduling of power exchange, a day ahead of the actual dispatch.

Next, it has a broad spectrum of applications including utility networks, energy storage systems (ESS), etc. However, an accurate capacity estimation of batteries in ESS is mandatory for their safe operations and decision making policy. ESS comprises of different storage mechanisms such as batteries, capacitors, etc. Consequently, the measurement of different charging profiles (CPs) has a strong relation to battery capacity. These profiles include temperature (T), voltage (V), and current (I) where the CPs patterns vary as the battery ages with cycles. Consequently, estimating a battery capacity, the conventional methods practice single channel charging profile (SCCP) and hop multiple channel CPs (MCCPs) that cause incorrect battery health estimation. To tackle these issues, this article proposes MCCPs based battery management system (BMS) to estimate batteries health/capacity through the deep learning (DL) concept where the patterns in these CPs are changed as the battery ages with time and cycles. Thus, we deeply investigate both machine learning (ML) and DL based methods to provide a concrete comparative analysis of our method. The adaptive boosting (AB) and support vector regression (SVR) are widely compared with long short-term memory (LSTM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) to attain the appropriate approach for battery capacity and state of health (SOH) estimation. These approaches have a high learning capability of inter-relation between the battery capacity and variation in CPs patterns. To validate and verify the proposed technique, we use NASA battery dataset and experimentally prove that BiLSTM outperforms all the approaches and obtains the smallest error values for MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE using MCCPs compared to SCCP.  © 2013 IEEE.","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:54","2024-01-24 11:17:54","","7797-7813","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe um sistema de gerenciamento de bateria baseado em múltiplos canais de perfis de carga para estimar a saúde/capacidade das baterias por meio do conceito de aprendizagem profunda onde os padrões nesses perfis de carga são alterados à medida que a bateria envelhece com o tempo e os ciclos.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Deep learning; Learning systems; machine learning; Charging (batteries); Secondary batteries; smart grid; Decision making; renewable energy sources; deep learning; Multilayer neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Long short-term memory; Energy storage; ensemble learning; Support vector regression; Energy storage systems; Support vector regression (SVR); Data storage equipment; Battery management systems; Battery management system; bi-directional LSTM; Bismuth compounds; capacity; Capacity estimation; Comparative analysis; Conventional methods; energy storage systems; Health risks; Learning capabilities; lithium-ion battery; Multi layer perceptron; NASA; Prognostics and health managements; state of health; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it leads to challenges for the energy scheduling of individual prosumers in terms of identifying idiosyncratic pricing patterns, cost-effectively predicting power profiles, and scheduling various scales of generation and consumption sources. To overcome these three challenges, this study proposes a novel data-driven energy scheduling model for an individual prosumer. The pricing patterns of a prosumer are represented by three types of dynamic price elasticities, i.e., the price elasticities of the generation, consumption, and carbon emissions. To improve the computational efficiency and scalability, the heuristic algorithms used to solve the optimisation problems is replaced by the convolutional neural networks which map the pricing patterns to scheduling decisions of a prosumer. The variations of uncertainties caused by the intermittency of renewable energy sources, flexible demand, and dynamic prices are predicted by the developed real-time scenarios selection approach, in which each variation is defined as a scenario. Case studies under various IEEE test distribution systems and uncertain scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed energy scheduling model in terms of predicting scheduling decisions in microseconds with high accuracy. © 2021","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:54","2024-01-24 11:17:54","","","","","308","","Appl.

However, the intermittence of renewable energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic leads to some challenges in terms of balancing generation and consumption. This paper aims to present a novel multi-agent model based intelligent control scheme to balance the home/building alternative current (AC)-direct current (DC) load demands and renewable energy sources. The new proposed scheme consists of a three-level hierarchical multi agent system based on cooperation, communication and interaction between intelligent agents to fulfill the load's requirements. Then, the proposed multi agent framework is simulated using four different nanogrids to prove its effectiveness using different temporal profiles for loads and generators. The proposed model is designed to be modular, so that it can be considered as a sample from a set of similar modules, assigned to different buildings to allow efficient energy sharing and balancing. The used approach in this concept is inspired from auto-similar systems, which is well suited and easy to implement on multi agent systems.

Specifically, this type of forecasting is essential for energy management systems in buildings, industries and microgrids for optimizing the operation of their distributed energy resources under different criteria based on their expected daily energy balance (the consumption–generation relationship). Under this situation, this paper proposes a complete framework for the short-term multistep forecasting of electric power consumption and generation in smart grids and microgrids. One advantage of the proposed framework is its capability of evaluating numerous combinations of inputs, making it possible to identify the best technique and the best set of inputs in each case. Therefore, even in cases with insufficient input information, the framework can always provide good forecasting results. Particularly, in this paper, the developed framework is used to compare a whole set of rule-based and machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and random forests) to perform day-ahead forecasting. Moreover, the paper presents and a new approach consisting of the use of baseline models as inputs for machine learning models, and compares it with others. Our results show that this approach can significantly improve upon the compared techniques, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 62% over that of a persistence model, which is the best of the compared algorithms across all application cases.

In addition, it is necessary to attend sustainable development in a conciliated manner. Applications involving the intelligent management of the distributed networks have increased to achieve a balance between growth and sustainability. In this context, this article presents the development of an Intelligent Electric Power Management System (IEPMS) for the economic maximisation of a photovoltaic system applied to a prosumer residential unit without storage in Brazil. Using historical meteorological data and a heuristic to simulate energy use habits, the IEPMS forecasts both generation and demand in 24 hours. From the projections, an optimisation problem was built and solved using the genetic algorithm technique to find the most economical moments for driving loads. This model aims to reach the lowest daily cost of electricity, considering the return (sale) of unused energy to the power distribution company. The validation of the IEPMS considered four usage patterns, integrating 26 scenarios, those composed by the (i) flexibility; (ii) type of tariff; and (iii) hit rates provided by the climate forecasting method proposed for the system. As a result, the IEPMS savings considering the white tariff were 34.72% for one year, assuming full-time external work usage. Additionally, it was possible to identify in all scenarios that the proposed method's performance was not less than 97%, measured through the relative error among distinct hit rates of the evaluated climatic forecast.  © 2013 IEEE.","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:54","2024-01-24 11:20:42","","48713-48731","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta o desenvolvimento de um Sistema Inteligente de Gerenciamento de Energia Elétrica para a maximização econômica de um sistema fotovoltaico aplicado a uma unidade residencial prosumer sem armazenamento no Brasil.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric energy storage; Digital storage; Housing; Smart grid; Microgrids; Optimization; Uncertainty; Genetic algorithms; Forecasting; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; energy management systems; Meteorology; Power management; intelligent systems; Load modeling; Photovoltaic systems; Electric power system economics; Photovoltaic cells; Cost of electricity; Distributed networks; electric power management; Electric power management; Electric power measurement; Equipment efficiency; Intelligent management; Optimisation problems; Power distribution company; residential prosumer unit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forecasting the energy consumption in buildings is essential for improving energy efficiency and sustainable development, and thereby reducing energy costs and environmental impact. This investigation presents a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) techniques for forecasting energy consumption time series using actual data. Real-time data were collected from a smart grid that was installed in an experimental building and used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of statistical and ML techniques. Well-known artificial intelligence techniques were used to analyze energy consumption in single and ensemble scenarios.

However, grid integration of small-scale photovoltaic (PV) solar systems still remains unresolved. High penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) results in technical challenges for grid operators. To address this, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) have been defined and developed to manage distributed energy resources with the aim of facilitating the integration of RESs. This paper introduces a hybrid irradiance forecasting approach aimed at facilitating the integration of PV systems into a VPP, especially when a historical irradiance dataset is exiguous or non-existent. This approach is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and a novel similar hour-based selection algorithm, has been tested for a real PV installation, and has been validated also considering irradiance measurements from an aggregation of ground-based meteorological stations, which emulate the nodes of a VPP. Under a reduced historical dataset, the results show that the proposed similar hour-based method produces the best forecasts with regard to those obtained by the ANN-based approach. This is particularly true for one-month and two-month datasets minimizing the mean error by 16.32% and 9.07% respectively. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis has been carried out between the hybrid method and the most used benchmarks in the literature, namely, the persistence method and the method based on similar days. It has been demonstrated conclusively that the proposed model yields promising results regardless the length of the historical dataset. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

One of the significant technical challenges in MG applications is to improve the power quality of the system subjected to unknown disturbances. Hence innovative control strategies are vital to cope with the problem. In this paper, an innovative online intelligent energy storage-based controller is proposed to improve the power quality of a MG system; in particular, voltage and frequency regulation at steady state conditions are targeted. The MG system under consideration in this paper consists of two distributed generators, a diesel synchronous generator, and a photovoltaic power system integrated with a battery energy storage system. The proposed control approach is based on hybrid differential evolution optimization (DEO) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The controller parameters have been optimized under several operating conditions. The obtained input and output patterns are consequently used to train the ANNs in order to perform an online tuning for the controller parameters. Finally, the proposed DEO-ANN methodology has been evaluated under random disturbances, and its performance is compared with a benchmark controller. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:19:43","","","","11","12","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta um controlador online inteligente baseado em armazenamento de energia para melhorar a qualidade da energia de um sistema de microgeração; em particular, visa-se a regulação de tensão e frequência em condições de estado estacionário.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Microgrids; Optimization; Controllers; Neural networks; Electric batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Battery storage; Distributed power generation; microgrids; photovoltaic system; Benchmarking; Artificial neural networks; artificial neural networks; Photovoltaic systems; Micro grid; Photovoltaic cells; Evolutionary algorithms; Data storage equipment; Diesel engines; battery energy storage systems; differential evolution optimization; Differential evolution optimizations; power quality improvement; Power quality improvement; Synchronous generators; Diesel synchronous generator; Differential evolution optimization; Photovoltaic system; TECHNOLOGIES; SYSTEMS; CONVERTERS; diesel synchronous generator; INTEGRATION; LOAD FREQUENCY CONTROL; RESOURCES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a fully distributed method based on the consensus algorithm for solving the economic dispatch problem (EDP) of DC microgrids. The proposed distributed method is performed using a multiagent system. It only needs information from neighboring agents and does not need a central controller. A two-level control structure is adopted to realize the economic dispatch and voltage regulation simultaneously. The upper level obtains the optimal power reference of dispatchable agents and maintains the power balance of the system. The lower level performs an improved droop control to track the power reference and regulate the average bus voltage for the microgrid. The proposed method's properties and convergence are analyzed using eigenvalue perturbation theory to obtain a faster convergence speed. By designing the adjacency matrix appropriately, the proposed method can ensure the system stable when the communication topology changes. Finally, several simulations are designed to verify the effectiveness of this novel control method.  © 2013 IEEE.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","119345-119356","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe um método totalmente distribuído baseado no algoritmo de consenso para resolver o problema de despacho econômico (EDP) de microrredes CC.

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization.

Distributed generators that are supplied by intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) are being connected to the grids. As RES get cheaper, more customers are opting for peer-to-peer energy interchanges through the smart metering infrastructure. Consequently, power management in grid-tied RES-based microgrids has become a challenging task. This paper reviews the applications of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in managing power in grid-tide microgrids. Unlike other optimization methods such as numerical and soft computing techniques, RL does not require an accurate model of the optimization environment in order to arrive at an optimal solution. In this paper, various challenges associated with the control of power in grid-tied microgrids are described. The application of RL techniques in addressing those challenges is reviewed critically. This review identifies the need to improve and scale multi-agent RL methods to enable seamless distributed power dispatch among interconnected microgrids. Finally, the paper gives directions for future research, e.g., the hybridization of intrinsic and extrinsic reward schemes, the use of transfer learning to improve the learning outcomes of RL in complex power systems environments and the deployment of priority-based experience replay in post-disaster microgrid power flow control.  © 2013 IEEE.","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","208992-209007","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo revisa as aplicações de algoritmos de aprendizagem por reforço no gerenciamento de energia em microrredes grid-tide.

In this paper a novel comprehensive methodology aiming at computing the PV power forecast on different time horizons and resolutions is introduced. Moving from the 24-hours ahead prediction provided by the Physical Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (PHANN), a technique to refine the power forecast for the following 3 hours with an hourly granularity is analyzed, leveraging on newer information available during the operations. Moreover, in order to provide the power forecast for the following 30 minutes on a minutely basis, an innovative modification of a statistical technique is proposed, the robust persistence.

However, the grid connection of large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources increases the complexity of operational control of power systems. With the increase in intermittent renewable energy grid connections, distribution system operators must optimize and integrate these new participants to ensure the flexibility and stability of smart grids. Dividing the smart grid into logical clusters helps to overcome the problems caused by intermittent renewable energy grid connections. In this study, we propose a 2-step modeling approach that includes both link and leverage analyses to detect the network partitioning and assess the stability of the smart grids.

The leverage results of benchmark networks indicate that the computational time of each instance with the proposed linear programming model for leverage (ID1) and quadratic programming model for leverage (ID2) was substantially reduced, and the Critical Node Problem (CNP) results of medium- and large-scale networks were better than those reported in the literature, which play a significant role in smart grid optimization.  © 2013 IEEE.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:20:47","","100234-100246","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Clusterização</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>A divisão da rede inteligente em clusters lógicos ajuda a superar os problemas causados ​​pelas ligações intermitentes à rede de energia renovável. estudo, propomos uma abordagem de modelagem em 2 etapas.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I2</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric power system control; Power grids; Renewable energy source; Smart power grids; Renewable energy resources; Smart grid; smart grid; Natural resources; Electric power transmission networks; Renewable energies; Renewable energy sources; Linear programming; Smart grids; Quadratic programming; Power systems stability; Power- generations; Computational modelling; Electric power system stability; Grid partition; grid partitions; Intermittent renewable energy; leverage analysis; Leverage analysis; link analysis; Link analysis; Social networking (online); Power system stability; SYSTEM; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; Computational modeling; Power generation; NETWORKS; Analytical models; COMMUNITY DETECTION; IDENTIFY KEY PLAYERS; INFORMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the major challenges associated with microgrids is the design and implementation of a suitable communication-control architecture that can coordinate actions with system operating conditions. In this paper, the focus is to enhance the intelligence of microgrid networks using a multi-agent system while validation is carried out using network performance metrics i.e., delay, throughput, jitter, and queuing. Network performance is analyzed for the small, medium and large scale microgrid using Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) test systems. In this paper, multi-agent-based Bellman routing (MABR) is proposed where the Bellman– Ford algorithm serves the system operating conditions to command the actions of multiple agents installed over the overlay microgrid network. The proposed agent-based routing focuses on calculating the shortest path to a given destination to improve network quality and communication reliability. The algorithm is defined for the distributed nature of the microgrid for an ideal communication network and for two cases of fault injected to the network. From this model, up to 35%–43.3% improvement was achieved in the network delay performance based on the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic model for microgrids. © 2020 by the authors.

On the other hand, privatization and integration of independently operated distributed resources in energy systems have caused the introduction of multi-agent structures. In this regard, new operational management methodologies should be employed by the MG operator (MGO) to efficiently operate the system while addressing the distributed nature of multi-agent structures. Accordingly, this paper aims to provide a new algorithm to operate an islanded multi-agent MG utilizing the peer-to-peer (P2P) management concept, which copes with the distributed nature of the system. Consequently, each agent would independently schedule its respective local resources while participating in the hourly P2P market scheme. Moreover, MGO manages the power transactions among the agents. Furthermore, different types of power generation resources are modeled in the proposed optimization scheme while scenario-based stochastic optimization, as well as the condition-value-at-risk index, are deployed to address the uncertainty and the operational risk associated with the operational optimization of renewable energy resources. Finally, the developed framework is implemented on a 10-bus-MG test system to investigate its effectiveness in the management of the system and also on a 33-bus-MG test system to study its scalability.  © 2013 IEEE.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","83636-83649","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo tem como objetivo fornecer um novo algoritmo para operar um MG multiagente ilhado utilizando o conceito de gerenciamento peer-to-peer (P2P), que lida com a natureza distribuída do sistema. </p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Microgrid; Multi agent systems; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources; Optimization; Uncertainty; Distributed energy resources; Distributed Energy Resources; Stochastic systems; Peer to peer networks; Power; Optimisations; Distributed power generation; Renewable energies; Stochastic optimizations; Distributed computer systems; Multi agent; renewable energies; Random processes; DER; DERs; multi-agent microgrid; Multi-agent microgrid; Operational optimization; P2P operational optimization; Peer-to-peer computing; peer-to-peer management; Peer-to-peer management; Power system; Privatization; Risk perception; stochastic optimization; Value engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for time-series load prediction. Yearly demand growth has also been considered in the optimization process based on the forecasted load profile. Two different case studies are performed with the forecasted and historical load profiles, respectively. According to the results, by considering the predicted load profile, realistic results of net present cost (NPC), cost of energy (COE), and MG configuration would be achieved. The NPC and COE are obtained as 566,008$ and 0.0240 $/kWh, respectively. It is also demonstrated that utilizing battery storage systems (BSSs) is not economic in the proposed approach. The introduced MG also produces lower emissions compared to the system with the historical load profile. In this regard, 563,909 kg of CO2 is produced over the optimization year, which is 35,623 kg lower than the case with no load growth rate. According to the sensitivity analysis results, when the inflation rate increases from 18.16 % to 32.36 %, the COE's value rises to 0.021 USD/kWh accordingly. In contrast, the NPC of the system decreases significantly from above 400 × 103 USD to about 200 × 103 USD as the inflation rate increases from 18.16 to 32.36. © 2021 River Publishers","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","345-362","","4","35","","Distrib.

In addition, demand-side energy devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) and mobile robots can also balance energy supply and demand when effectively deployed. However, the fluctuation of energy generated by renewable resources makes balancing energy supply a challenging goal. This paper proposes a semi-decentralized robust network of electric vehicles (NoEV) integration system for power management in a smart grid platform. The proposed approach integrates an aggregator with EV fleets into a blockchain framework. The EVs execute a multi-stage algorithm to predict the power consumption based on a novel federated learning algorithm named Federated Learning for Qualified Local Model Selection (FL-QLMS). From the evaluation results, the proposed system requires 35% fewer transactions in short intervals and propagation delays than the previous approaches and achieves better network efficiency while maintaining a high level of security. Moreover, NoEV achieves a 5.7% lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the conventional approach for power consumption prediction, which is a significant improvement. In addition, the FL-QLMS approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness to client-side attacks. The evaluation results also show that the performance of FL-QLMS is not affected when 10% to 40% percent of the models are manipulated.  © 2013 IEEE.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","37082-37096","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo propõe um sistema de integração de rede robusta semi-descentralizada de veículos elétricos (NoEV) para gerenciamento de energia em uma plataforma de rede inteligente.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Renewable energy source; Electric power utilization; Renewable energy resources; Smart grid; Electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; smart grid; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Block-chain; Blockchain; Network security; Power; Mean square error; Power management; Computational modelling; Vehicle to grids; EVs; AI-enabled; blockchain-based; Blockchain-based; Collaborative Work; Power demands; power-management; Power-management; robust; Robust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Demand Response (DR) service provision takes place via aggregators and special distribution-level markets (e.g., flexibility markets), where small, distributed DR resources, such as building energy management systems, electric vehicle charging stations, micro-generation and storage, connected to the low-voltage distribution grid, offer DR services. In such systems, energy balancing (and thus, also DR decisions) have to be made close to real-time. Thus, market clearing algorithms for DR service provision must fulfill several requirements related to the efficiency of their operation. More specifically, a DR market clearing algorithm needs to be optimal in terms of cost-efficiency, scalable in terms of number of assets and locations, and able to satisfy real-time constraints. In order to cope with these challenges, this article presents a distributed DR market clearing algorithm based on Lagrangian decomposition, combined with an optimal cloud resource allocation algorithm for assigning the required computation power. A heuristic algorithm is also presented, able to achieve a near-optimal solution, within negligible computational time. Simulations, performed on a testbed, demonstrate the computational burden introduced by various DR models, as well as the heuristic algorithm's near-optimal performance. The resource allocation algorithm is able to service multiple DR requests (e.g., in multiple distribution networks), and minimize the cost of computational resources while respecting the execution time constraints of each request. This enables third parties to offer cost-efficient and competitive DR operation as a service.  © 2013 IEEE.","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","82-96","","1","10","","IEEE Trans.

Awareness of how the energy is produced must complement awareness of how it is consumed. In the economic context, the gains derive from predictability across the entire supply chain. This paper represents a compressive study on how standard recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent units can be used to forecast power production of photovoltaic (PV) systems. This approach can be used for other use cases in solar or even wind power prediction since it provides solid fundamentals for working with weather data and recurrent artificial neural networks, being the core of any smart grid management system. Few studies have explored how these models should be implemented, and even fewer have compared the outcomes of different model types. The data used consist of weather and power production data with a one-hour resolution. The data were further pre-processed to unveil the maximum information. The most effective model parameters were selected to make the forecast. Solar energy plays a key role among other renewable energy sources in the European Union’s climate action and the European Green Deal. Under these initiatives, important regulations are implemented and financial resources made available for those who possess the capabilities required to solve the open points. The much-needed predictability that gives the flexibility and robustness needed for deploying and adopting more renewable technologies can be ensured by utilizing a neural-based predictive approach. © 2021, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Balancing services are needed, which can be provided by virtual power plants (VPP) that aggregate distributed energy resources (DER) to consume or produce electricity on demand. Electric vehicle (EV) fleets can use idle cars' batteries as combined storage to offer balancing services on smart electricity markets. However, there are risks associated with this business model extension. The fleet faces severe imbalance penalties if it cannot charge the offered amount of balancing energy due to the vehicles' unpredicted mobility demand. Ensuring the fleet can fulfill all market commitments risks denying profitable customer rentals. We study the design of a decision support system that estimates these risks, dynamically adjusts the composition of a VPP portfolio, and profitably places bids on multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Here we show that a reinforcement learning agent can optimize the VPP portfolio by learning from favorable market conditions and fleet demand uncertainties. In comparison to previous research, in which the bidding risks were unknown and fleets could only offer conservative amounts of balancing power to a single market, our proposed approach increases the amount of offered balancing power by 48% to 82% and achieves a charging cost reduction of the fleet by 25%. In experiments with real-world carsharing data of 500 EVs, we found that mobility demand forecasting algorithms' accuracy is crucial for a successful bidding strategy. Moreover, we show that recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning decrease the convergence time and improve the results' robustness. Our results demonstrate how modern RL algorithms can be successfully used for fleet management, VPP optimization, and demand response in the smart grid. We anticipate that DER, such as EVs, will play an essential role in providing reliable backup power for the grid and formulate market design recommendations to allow easier access to these resources. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:55","2024-01-24 11:17:55","","","","8","31","","Int.

India is a developing country and blessed with a huge amount of renewable energy resources still there are various remote areas where the grid supply is rarely available. As electrical energy is the basic requirement, therefore it must be taken up on priority to exploit the available renewable energy resources integrated with storage devices like fuel cells and batteries for power generation and help the planners in providing the energy-efficient and alternative solution. This solution will not only meet electricity demand but also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result the efficient, sustainable and eco-friendly solution can be achieved which would contribute a lot to the smart grid environment. In this paper, a modified grey wolf optimizer approach is utilized to develop a hybrid microgrid based on available renewable energy resources considering modern power grid interactions. The proposed approach would be able to provide a robust and efficient microgrid that utilizes solar photovoltaic technology and wind energy conversion system. This approach integrates renewable resources with the meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for optimal dispatch of energy in grid-connected hybrid microgrid system. The proposed approach is mainly aimed to provide the optimal sizing of renewable energy-based microgrids based on the load profile according to time of use. To validate the proposed approach, a comparative study is also conducted through a case study and shows a significant savings of 30.88% and 49.99% of the rolling cost in comparison with fuzzy logic and mixed integer linear programming-based energy management system respectively. © 2021","2022","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","5564-5576","","8","47","","Int J Hydrogen Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo traz uma abordagem modificada do otimizador do lobo cinzento é utilizada para desenvolver uma microrrede híbrida baseada em recursos de energia renovável disponíveis, considerando as interações modernas da rede elétrica.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric energy storage; Energy management systems; Energy policy; Microgrid; Smart power grids; Electrical energy; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Smart grid; Electric power transmission networks; Wind power; Sustainable development; Grid environments; Storage systems; Fuel cells; Integer programming; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Fuel storage; Fuzzy logic; Solar power generation; Power- generations; Energy storage system; Virtual storage; Optimization techniques; Developing countries; Hybrid optimization; Optimization technique; Remote areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has gained significance in solving various industrial problems. Robust and scalable Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure is critical for efficient control of MG. IoT Devices with efficient measurement and control capability can play a key role in the MG environment. In this paper three layers hierarchical control of inverter based MG was developed using cloud-based IoT infrastructure and machine learning (ML) based islanding detection scheme. MG was operated in both island and grid connected mode. In the Primary layer, a voltage frequency (V-F) droop control with virtual impedance control was applied to avoid the disturbances in island mode. Moreover, Active Reactive (P-Q) power control was used for grid connected mode. In the secondary layer voltage and frequency deviations were removed by using the decentralized averaging based method. Voltage and frequency from each distributed generator (DG) were communicated by using a lightweight IoT-based protocol through an edge device (ED). Context-aware policy (CAP) was adopted in ED to optimize traffic flow over a communication network (CN) by comparing the difference in the present and previous data values. In the tertiary layer, a cloud-based ML model was developed using an artificial neural network (ANN) for islanding detection. ANN model was trained by data produced by simulating islanding scenarios in Matlab. Phasor measurement unit (PMU) data was communicated to the cloud for island prediction. The Proposed scheme was implemented on a modified IEEE-13 bus system with four inverter-based distributed generators (DGs) in Matlab, and Microsoft cloud services were used. The successful implementation of MG hierarchical control using an IoT feedback network with less data traffic along with cloud-based islanding detection using machine learning are the main contributions in this work. The whole system achieves stability within 2 seconds of islanding according to IEEE 1547 standards.  © 2013 IEEE.","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:20:33","","103019-103031","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>Neste artigo, o controle hierárquico de três camadas de desempenho da Microrrede baseado em inversor foi desenvolvido usando infraestrutura de IoT baseada em nuvem e esquema de detecção de ilhamento baseado em aprendizado de máquina.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Electric power system control; Renewable energy source; machine learning; Machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Microgrids; MATLAB; Internet of things; IoT; Distributed power generation; Multilayer neural networks; Cloud computing; microgrid; Smart grids; Electric inverters; Power control; Islanding; Information communication technology; Phasor measurement units; Distributed generators; Power system stability; context aware policy; Context-aware policies; edge device; Grid-connected modes; hierarchical control; IEEE Standards; Internet of thing (IOT); Inverter-based distributed generators; Measurement and control; smartgrid; Web services; SYSTEMS; ARCHITECTURES; Delays; INTERNET; Real-time systems; TRENDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the automatic restoration processes need optimal power flow results in the SDN at fault times. Hence, this study proposed the optimal two-stage coordinated energy management approach (CEMA) and self-healing strategy (SHS) in the SDN in the presence of coupling neighbouring microgrids (CNMGs) according to autonomous decentralized restoration technique (ADRT). In the first stage, the SDN operation cost receiving from the upstream grid was minimized to obtain flexible and reliable network, followed by addressing network power flow equations, CNMG constraints including the renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs), and SDN operating limits. In the second stage, the optimal model of the ADRT formwork was defined based on the multi-agent system (MAS). Also, the suitable restoration path was obtained with different zone agents distributed across the network CNMGs considering the minimization of the difference between the number of switching operation and priority loads restored as the normalized objective function. Furthermore, the scenario-based stochastic programming was used to model the uncertainty of energy price, load, RES power, and EVs parameters. Finally, the proposed problem was solved by the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm and simulated on 33-bus radial distribution network using MATLAB software. According to numerical results, the proposed strategy can offer the self-healing and flexible-reliable SDN in addition to the well-suited overloading management for CNMGs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","","","11","30","","Int.

Developing the methods useful for this type of forecast is the main aim of this study. We prepared a comprehensive study based on fragmentary time series, including 4 full days, of 5 min power generation. This problem is particularly important to microgrids’ operation control, i.e., for the proper operation of small energy micro-systems. The forecasting of power generation by renewable energy sources on a very-short-term horizon, including PV systems, is very important, especially in the island mode of microgrids’ operation. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to the improper operation of microgrids or increasing costs/decreasing profits for microgrid operators. This paper presents a short description of the performance of photovoltaic systems, particularly the main environmental parameters, and a very detailed statistical analysis of data collected from four sample time series of power generation in an existing PV system, which was located on the roof of a building. Different forecasting methods, which can be employed for this type of forecast, and the choice of proper input data in these methods were the subject of special attention in this paper. Ten various prognostic methods (including hybrid and team methods) were tested. A new, proprietary forecasting method— a hybrid method using three independent MLP-type neural networks—was a unique technique devised by the authors of this paper. The forecasts achieved with the use of various methods are presented and discussed in detail. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the forecasts, achieved using different measures of quality, was performed. Some of the presented prognostic models are, in our opinion, promising tools for practical use, e.g., for operation control in low-voltage microgrids. The most favorable forecasting methods for various sets of input variables were indicated, and practical conclusions regarding the problem under study were formulated. Thanks to the analysis of the utility of different forecasting methods for four analyzed, separate time series, the reliability of conclusions related to the recommended methods was significantly increased. © 2022 by the authors.

Efficient integration of these DGs in a microgrid, whether in grid-connected or islanded mode, poses many challenges, such as optimal power sharing, control of load-side and generator-side transients, and economic dispatch (ED), to name a few. Different control strategies for power sharing and ED fall short in providing good dynamic performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution that provides ED with improved dynamic performance. Specifically, the ED problem employs dynamic performance controller based on proportional-integral-derivative control for improved performance by using an augmented Lagrangian-based approach. For the distributed coordinated control of DGs, we utilize a multiagent system architecture. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed solution for ED improves the overall system performance of the microgrid. The system achieves an optimal state, where DGs operate at minimum cost while improving the transient response during load or generator switching. © 2017 IEEE","2019","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","802-812","","1","13","","IEEE Syst.

A reconfigurable system is defined as a set of implementations, each of which is encoded by real-time periodic software tasks. Reconfiguration is a flexible runtime scenario that adapts the current system's implementation to any related environment evolution under well-defined conditions. A task is characterized by an effective calculated deadline that should be less than a maximum deadline defined in user requirements. The main problem is how to calculate the effective deadlines of the different periodic tasks in the different implementations under possibly the predicted renewable energy source and the sharing of resource constraints. We propose an offline method based on three solutions to calculate the deadlines of tasks. The first serves to compute the deadlines ensuring the real-time system feasibility and also minimizes the number of context switches by assigning the highest priority to the task with the smallest maximum deadline. The second computes the deadlines ensuring the respect of energy constraints, and the third computes the deadlines ensuring the respect of resource sharing constraints. These three solutions calculate the possible deadlines of each task in the hyperperiod of the corresponding implementations. We develop a new simulator called DEAD-CALC, that integrates a new tool called RANDOM-TASK for applying and evaluating the proposed solutions. The conducted experimentation proves that this methodology provides deadlines with affecting neither the load nor the processor speed while reducing the calculation time. Note to Practitioners - Real-time software is particularly difficult to design since, in addition to ever more complex functional constraints, it has to satisfy a set of stringent nonfunctional requirements, such as deadlines. In fact, the violation of deadlines can lead to breakdowns, data loss, and so on, which can be catastrophic for critical applications. This article presents the DEAD-CALC project for computing efficiently the deadlines of reconfigurable real-time devices to run possibly under energy and resource sharing constraints in all the system implementations. A device, in the software level, is a superset of implementations, each of which (i.e., a set of periodic software tasks) is activated and executed at a particular time according to user requirements. DEAD-CALC reduces the development time by computing the deadlines to be certainly respected without any additional feasibility analysis of the device. The calculation can only consider the real-time aspects, or both the harvesting energy and resource sharing constraints, giving the user the ability to configure the system under different conditions. DEAD-CALC is a visual environment that can be simply used by designers to compute and display these deadlines, with a few clicks, in arranged tables, and in a short time. This project can be a future reference for industrial partners who will be focusing on various real-time applications design, such as the intelligent manufacturing industry, intelligent transportation systems, embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, smart grids, medical control devices, and military platforms.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","1492-1504","","3","18","","IEEE Trans.

Smart island is defined as insular territory with the ability to implement integrated solutions to the management of infrastructures and natural resources. The distributed optimization is accomplished by using primal-dual method of multipliers which has shown more promising performance in terms of execution time and convergence rate compared to the alternating-direction method of multipliers. The proposed energy management scheme is carried out between 5 different agents including an energy hub, a networked multi-microgrid with 3 agents and a transportation system. The transportation system comprises of the subway system and plug-in electric vehicles. The proposed networked multi-microgrid is made up of 3 microgrid systems, each one comprises of wind generation units, photovoltaic units and a tidal unit. Despite the assumption that the agents are both suppliers and consumers of energy and are completely operated and separated from the other sections, they share energy through a peer-to-peer energy trading. Such sharing scheme will be ended up by obtaining an equilibrium point through which a consensus is reached and all the parties are satisfied. Results prove the validity of the proposed approach in providing a proper energy negotiation framework in a smart island in terms of accuracy and applicability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","","","","208","","Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo concentra-se basicamente em fornecer uma estrutura apropriada de gestão de energia distribuída em ilhas inteligentes utilizando modelagem matemática.

The novelty involved in this article is designing a renewable energy-based smart grid system incorporating with Artificial Neural Network for maintaining an improved voltage profile with balanced reactive power level across the grid network. The objective is attained by implementing renewable energy sources, namely solar and wind energy modules, with artificial intelligence techniques for effective reactive power control using DSTATCOM. The power requirement across the power grid network is satisfied by providing solar and wind energy sources managing the smart-grid system’s var level. The optimized power is trained on the Feed Forward Neural Network-based for calculating the amount of voltage profile and power loss based on system load. The DSTATCOM is an optimal var compensating device for maintaining the reactive power within the permissible limit across the smart grid system. The proposed system improves the voltage profile, reduces the power loss, and satisfies the grid by managing the system’s reactive power balance. The proposed approach is executed in MATLAB/Simulink work site, and the performance is analyzed with three different cases. The smart grid system powered with hybrid energy sources strives to attain the objective functions effectively among the three different cases.

From other non-conventional sources, solar energy has been seen as a promising and convenient source used around the globe. In terms of meeting the daily requirements, solar energy has huge potential to fulfil the world's demand. However, firstly the characteristic of solar energy is very unpredictable and intermittent due to variation of weather. Secondly, the optimization and the planning of smart grid effect the operation of PV system. Thus, prediction on the long horizon is needed to address this problem. Nevertheless, long term forecasting of solar power generation is deliberated as a challenging problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a 10 day ahead solar power forecasting using combination of linear and non-linear machine learning models. At first, the outputs are generated from Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Autoregressive with exogenous variable (ARX). Later on, these three outputs are combined and are made as a strong classifier with the Adaptive boost (Adaboost) algorithm. The simulations were conducted on the data obtained from real PV plant. By the experimental results and discussion, it was endogenously concluded that the combination of all techniques with the Adaboost have increased the performances and showing the high accuracy as compare to the individual machine learning models. The hybrid Adaboost shows %MAPE 8.88, which proven high accuracy. While on the other hand, for the individual technique, RNN shows 10.88, SVM reveals 11.78 and ARX gives 13.00 of percentage MAPE. The improvement proves that combination of techniques performs better than individual models and proclaims the high accuracy. © 2021.

Unlike traditional fossil fuel-based resources, renewable energy sources potentially play a pivotal role in sustaining a country's economy and improving the quality of life. As our planet is nowadays facing serious challenges due to climate change and global warming, this research could be effective to achieve good prediction accuracy in smart grids using different weather conditions. In the current study, different machine learning models are compared to estimate power and energy of hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-wind renewable energy systems using seven weather factors that have a significant impact on the output of the PV–wind renewable energy system. This study classified the machine learning model which could be potentially useful and efficient to predict energy and power. The historic hourly data is processed with and without data manipulation. While data manipulations are carried out using recursive feature elimination using cross-validation (RFECV). The data is trained using artificial neural network (ANN) regressors and correlations between different features within the dataset are identified.

With this motivation, efficient energy management model for a microgrid with ant colony optimization algorithm to systematically schedule load and EVs charging/discharging of is introduced. The smart microgrid is equipped with controllable appliances, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, electrolyzer, hydrogen tank, and energy storage system.

For an objective analysis of microgrids with large grid parity of renewable energy sources, probabilistic methods are required along with the already established deterministic methods. A Gauss quadrature-based probabilistic load flow (GQPLF) method for microgrid has been proposed along with intermittent generation and uncertain loads, including electric vehicles (EVs). The distributed generation consists of wind turbine generation systems (WTGS) and photovoltaic systems (PVs) connected to 14 bus microgrid systems with six droop-controlled distributed generators. Extensive simulations have been carried out on a 14-bus microgrid with distributed generation and uncertain loads, and results are compared with the benchmark Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method, which validates the efficacy of the proposed method. The time taken by the proposed GQPLF for the 14-bus microgrid system simulation is 60.9 seconds, which is significantly less compared to the benchmark Monte Carlo simulation method, in which time taken for a 14-bus microgrid system with 10,000 simulations is 9318.7 seconds. Comparing the proposed GQPLF method with the benchmark method validates its efficacy and efficiency. © 2022 Neeraj Gupta and B.

Not only does energy forecasting using renewable energy sources help mitigate the greenhouse effect, it also helps to conserve energy for future use. Over the years, several methods for energy forecasting have been proposed, all of which were more concerned with the accuracy of the prediction models with little or no considerations to the operating environment. This research, however, proposes the uses of Deep Neural Network (DNN) for energy forecasting on mobile devices at the edge of the network. This ensures low latency and communication overhead for all energy forecasting operations since they are carried out at the network periphery. Nevertheless, the cloud would be used as a support for the mobile devices by providing permanent storage for the locally generated data and a platform for offloading resource-intensive computations that exceed the capabilities of the local mobile devices as well as security for them. Electrical network topology was proposed which allows seamless incorporation of multiple RESs into the distributed renewable energy source (D-RES) network. Moreover, a novel grid control algorithm that uses the forecasting model to administer a well-coordinated and effective control for renewable energy sources (RESs) in the electrical network is designed. The electrical network was simulated with two RESs and a DNN model was used to create a forecasting model for the simulated network. The model was trained using a dataset from a solar power generation company in Belgium (elis) and was experimented with a different number of layers to determine the optimum architecture for performing the forecasting operations. The performance of each architecture was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE) and the r-square. © 2020, The Author(s).","2021","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","","","1","4","","Cybersecur.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>A pesquisa propõe o uso de Deep Neural Network para previsão de energia em dispositivos móveis na borda da rede.

Without an arbitration agent in MAS, peer agents calculate voltage sensitivities via agents' local and neighbourhood measurements in a fully decentralised approach. An incentive mechanism is designed to motivate the MGs in DNs to participate in voltage control with guaranteed subsidies to ensure individual rationality. On the basis of the voltage sensitivities, each MG decides its strategy by managing energy suppliers and consumers to maximise its own profit while providing the ancillary service of voltage control. The strategy converges through an iterative process to a Nash equilibrium which maximises each MG's profit. In addition, an incomplete information game is applied to ensure the privacy of MGs. Furthermore, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed voltage control method is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 33-bus system, and finally the existence of a Nash equilibrium in the game model is proved in the Appendix. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.","2018","2024-01-24 11:17:56","2024-01-24 11:17:56","","790-797","","3","12","","IET Gener.

An optimization problem in the form of a mixed integer linear program is formulated. It is executed over a rolling time horizon using predicted values of the microgrid electricity demand, renewable energy generation, EV connection and disconnection times, and the EV state of charge at time of connection. The solution to this optimization problem provides the on-site storage and EV charge/discharge powers. Both bidirectional and unidirectional charging scenarios are considered for EVs. The proposed optimal controller maximizes economic benefits and ensures user-specified charge levels are reached at the time of EV disconnection from the microgrid. By formulating the problem as a stochastic chance constraints optimization, significant improvement is shown in the system robustness over conventional rolling horizon controller, while dealing with uncertainties in the predictions of demand/generation, and EV state of charge and connection/disconnection times. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed chance constraints-based controller is highly effective in reducing cost and meeting the user desired EV charge level at time of disconnection from the microgrid, even in the presence of uncertainty. © 2016 IEEE.","2018","2024-01-24 11:17:57","2024-01-24 11:17:57","","346-359","","1","9","","IEEE Trans.

Sustainability is of great importance due to increasing demands and limited resources. Many problem classes in sustainable energy systems are data mining, optimization, and control tasks.

Second, in the upper-level agent, the energy management strategies are mainly designed by constructing multi-objective functions and by using a particle swarm optimization method based on hybrid probabilistic forecasting of renewable energy sources and loads. Third, in lower-level renewable energy source and load agents, the forecasting approach regarding renewable energy sources and loasd is mainly researched by means of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition combined with sparse Bayesian learning, called the hybrid probabilistic forecast approach. Moreover, in lower-level schedulable generation unit agents, local control strategies are also presented to regulate the output power to satisfy the reference power that is set by the upper-level agent.

However, due to intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, to what extent RDG could provide capacity to power systems becomes a critical issue to the utility company when implementing long-term system strategic (generation expansion) planning. On the other hand, in a smart-grid frame, the popularization of different varieties of demand-side resources enables the system to operate at more flexible modes ever before. The potential variability in load demand not only introduces additional dynamics and uncertainties to the system, but could also affect the reliability benefits of RDG. Therefore, in practice, to effectively estimate the reliability value of RDG in power systems, the potential interaction between generation- A nd demand-side must be properly captured. In this paper, a study to assess the capacity credit (CC) of RDG in a context of distributed generation system is performed with consideration of the impacts of demand response (DR). A compound reliability model for DR is presented, which considers the uncertainties involved in both instant response and follow-on load recovery processes. On this basis, an assessment framework for the CC of RDG based on sequential Monte Carlo simulation is developed by which the interoral characteristics of DR resources can be fully captured. The numerical study is implemented based on the IEEE-38 bus test case. The calculation results demonstrate that the CC of RDG would depend on a variety of factors, including penetration level, responsiveness of load demand and the correlations between RDG and DR availability. Also, it is shown that accounting for the underlying effect of DR is of absolute importance, otherwise the CC of RDG might be estimated erroneously in real practices. © 2013 IEEE.","2017","2024-01-24 11:17:57","2024-01-24 11:17:57","","14307-14317","","","6","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo apresenta um modelo de confiabilidade composto para resposta da demanda (DR), que considera as incertezas envolvidas tanto nos processos de resposta instantânea quanto nos processos subsequentes de recuperação de carga.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Renewable energy resources; Uncertainty; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Wind; Distributed power generation; Demand response; Electric load management; Reliability; Auto regressive process; capacity credit; Capacity credit; interaction; Interaction; Power system reliability; renewable distributed generation; Renewable distributed generations; sequential Monte Carlo simulation; Sequential Monte Carlo simulation; Wind speed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Operating power reserve should be carefully sized but also ideally minimized and dispatched to reduce operation costs with a satisfying security level. Although several energy generation and load forecasting tools have been developed, decision-making methods are required to estimate the operating power reserve amount within its dispatch over generators during small time windows and with adaptive capabilities to markets, as new ancillary service markets. This paper proposes an uncertainty analysis method for power reserve quantification in an urban microgrid with a high penetration ratio of PV (photovoltaic) power. First, forecasting errors of PV production and load demand are estimated one day ahead by using artificial neural networks. Then two methods are proposed to calculate one day ahead the net demand error. The first perform a direct forecast of the error, the second one calculates it from the available PV power and load demand forecast errors. This remaining net error is analyzed with dedicated statistical and stochastic procedures. Hence, according to an accepted risk level, a method is proposed to calculate the required PR for each hour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2024-01-24 11:17:57","2024-01-24 11:17:57","","288-297","","","106","","Renew.

Energy storage is a vital component for overcoming issues associated with the intermittent nature of such RES. Though stationary battery systems are used as energy storage for such applications, smart energy storage (SES) systems are also becoming popular owing to various advantages and advent of smart grid systems. SES can be achieved by aggregating electric vehicles (EVs) or by using demand response management for loads with large time constants. Aggregated residential refrigerators are potential candidates for creating SES which has virtual storage capacity, unlike EVs. In this study, residential refrigerators are modelled analogously to energy capacity and selfdischarge of electro-chemical batteries using the artificial neural network based kWh modelling. The model is further extended to estimate the virtual energy storage (VES) capacity with aggregated residential refrigerators; particularly in high-rise residential buildings. Simulation results are presented for scenarios covering the complete range of thermal capacity of typical refrigerators applicable in Singapore's climatic condition.

There is a need to add intelligence at all levels in the grid, acting over various time horizons. Predicting the behavior of the energy system is crucial to mitigate potential uncertainties. An accurate energy prediction at the customer level will reflect directly in efficiency improvements in the whole system. However, prediction of building energy consumption is complex due to many influencing factors, such as climate, performance of thermal systems, and occupancy patterns. Therefore, current state-of-the-art methods are not able to confine the uncertainty at the building level due to the many fluctuations in influencing variables. As an evolution of artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction methods, deep learning techniques are expected to increase the prediction accuracy by allowing higher levels of abstraction. In this paper, we investigate two newly developed stochastic models for time series prediction of energy consumption, namely Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) and Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM). The assessment is made on a benchmark dataset consisting of almost four years of one minute resolution electric power consumption data collected from an individual residential customer.

Given the deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources and the ever increasing consumption of electricity, the generation of accurate building-level electricity demand forecasts will be valuable to both grid operators and building energy management systems. The literature is rich with forecasting models for individual buildings. However, an ongoing challenge is the development of a broadly applicable method for demand forecasting across geographic locations, seasons, and use-types. This paper addresses the need for a generalizable approach to electricity demand forecasting through the formulation of an ensemble learning method that performs model validation and selection in real time using a gating function. By learning from electricity demand data streams, the method requires little knowledge of energy end-use, making it well suited for real deployments. While the ensemble method is capable of incorporating complex forecasters, such as Artificial Neural Networks or Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models, this work will focus on employing simpler models, such as Ordinary Least Squares and k-Nearest Neighbors. By applying our method to 32 building electricity demand data sets (8 commercial and 24 residential), we generate electricity demand forecasts with a mean absolute percent error of 7.5% and 55.8% for commercial and residential buildings, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this regard, municipal parking decks are viewed as distributed energy storage systems and the amount of available energy from these units in random contingency events is probabilistically modeled for reliability studies. Appropriate stochastic models are also introduced to capture the volatility and intermittency of renewable sources. Moreover, it is discussed that how the adopted outage management scheme (OMS) in contingency events can affect the reliability level of customers. In response, several OMSs on the basis of bankruptcy problem are proposed to fairly distribute the available resources among different microgrids/sections, once a failure occurs in the system. Subsequently, a general framework based on the non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is developed to evaluate different customers and system reliability indices in presence of emergency V2G programs. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through implementation on a test system and several case studies are presented.

In particular, EVs augment the grid with the ability to store energy at some points in the network and give it back at others and, therefore, help optimize the use of energy from intermittent renewable energy sources and let users refill their cars in a variety of locations. However, a number of challenges need to be addressed if such benefits are to be achieved. On the one hand, given their limited range and costs involved in charging EV batteries, it is important to design algorithms that will minimize costs and, at the same time, avoid users being stranded. On the other hand, collectives of EVs need to be organized in such a way as to avoid peaks on the grid that may result in high electricity prices and overload local distribution grids. In order to meet such challenges, a number of technological solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on those that utilize artificial intelligence techniques to render EVs and the systems that manage collectives of EVs smarter. In particular, we provide a survey of the literature and identify the commonalities and key differences in the approaches. This allows us to develop a classification of key techniques and benchmarks that can be used to advance the state of the art in this space. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","2015","2024-01-24 11:17:57","2024-01-24 11:17:57","","1619-1635","","4","16","","IEEE Trans.

The energy management problem was formulated here through the application of game theory, in order to model the set of strategies between two players/agents, as a non-cooperative power control game or a cooperative one, according to the level of the energy produced by the renewable energy sources and the energy stored in the battery bank, for the purpose of accomplishing optimal energy management and control of the microgrid operation. The Nash equilibrium was used to compromise the possible diverging goals of the agents by maximizing their preferences. The proposed energy management system was then compared with a multi-agent decentralized energy management system where all the agents were assumed to be cooperative and employed agent coordination through Fuzzy Cognitive Maps.

The smart grid concept is increasing its consensus as the most suitable solution to facilitate the small players' participation in electric power negotiations while improving energy efficiency. The opportunity for players' participation in multiple energy negotiation environments (smart grid negotiation in addition to the already implemented market types, such as day-ahead spot markets, balancing markets, intraday negotiations, bilateral contracts, forward and futures negotiations, and among other) requires players to take suitable decisions on whether to, and how to participate in each market type. This paper proposes a portfolio optimization methodology, which provides the best investment profile for a market player, considering different market opportunities. The amount of power that each supported player should negotiate in each available market type in order to maximize its profits, considers the prices that are expected to be achieved in each market, in different contexts. The price forecasts are performed using artificial neural networks, providing a specific database with the expected prices in the different market types, at each time. This database is then used as input by an evolutionary particle swarm optimization process, which originates the most advantage participation portfolio for the market player.

The multiagent system (MAS)-based distributed coordinated control strategies show the benefits to balance the power and energy, stabilize voltage and frequency, achieve economic and coordinated operation among the MGs and MGCs. However, the complex and diverse combinations of distributed generations (DGs) in MAS increase the complexity of system control and operation. In order to design the optimized configuration and control strategy using MAS, the topology models and mathematic models such as the graph topology model, noncooperative game model, the genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm are summarized. The merits and drawbacks of these control methods are compared. Moreover, since the consensus is a vital problem in the complex dynamical systems, the distributed MAS-based consensus protocols are systematically reviewed. On the other hand, the communication delay issue, which is inevitable no matter in the low- or high-bandwidth communication networks, is crucial to maintain the stability of the MGs and MGCs with fixed and random delays. Various control strategies to compensate the effect of communication delays have been reviewed, such as the neural network-based predictive control, the weighted average predictive control, the gain scheduling scheme, and synchronization schemes based on the multitimer model for the case of fixed communication delay, and the generalized predictive control, networked predictive control, model predictive control, Smith predictor, H-based control, sliding mode control for the random communication delay scenarios. Furthermore, various control methods have been summarized to describe switching topologies in MAS with different objectives, such as the plug-in or plug-out of DGs in an MG, and the plug-in or plug-out of MGs in an MGC, and multiagent-based energy coordination and the economic dispatch of the MGC. Finally, the future research directions of the multiagent-based distributed coordinated control and optimization in MGs and MGCs are also presented. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","2018","2024-01-24 11:17:58","2024-01-24 11:17:58","","6488-6508","","8","33","","IEEE Trans Power Electron","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Sistema Multiagente</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O projeto e configuração otimizada e a estratégia de controle foi realizada utilizando Sistemas Multiagentes, os modelos de topologia e modelos matemáticos, como o modelo de topologia de grafos, o modelo de jogo não cooperativo, o algoritmo genético e o algoritmo de otimização de enxame de partículas são resumidos.

Rapid proliferation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and integration of renewable energy sources in smart grids increase system-wide complexities. This study proposes an innovative approach to classify the energy consumptions of smart meter customers with typical profiles by processing with multi-layered clustering of energy consumption data of smart consumers extracted from the AMI. There are two stages for the approach of which the first stage analyses the data for intra-cluster similarity of energy consumption patterns and in case the patterns do not have a high intra-cluster similarity, they are fed back for re-clustering with multi-layered clustering process until the clearly identifiable energy patterns with high intra-cluster similarity is obtained. The second stage linearises the complex energy patterns using interpolant and curve fitting techniques until stabilised profiles are obtained. This study also proposes a methodology for smart meter load modelling for Monte Carlo (MC) simulation applications to reduce the computing time compared with traditional alternatives.

The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand-supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","2015","2024-01-24 11:17:58","2024-01-24 11:20:02","","40-52","","","52","","Environ.

The conceptual model of the household information system as a part of the common SMART GRID system was proposed. The main task of this system is continuous monitoring of the power net, prognostication of consumption of the energy consumed by domestic appliances and the energy produced by photovoltaic cell panels. Current and predicted data were obtained based on the use of current sensors and mathematical apparatus of neural-fuzzy logic. Importance and necessity of using SMART GRID technology for improving efficiency of power net operation was shown. Application of such systems can reduce energy costs and the environmental impact of energy systems. This effect is achieved by prognostication of the energy generated by domestic renewable energy sources, in particular photovoltaic cell panels which ensures more efficient energy management. Also, the proposed model of the information system makes it possible to account produced and consumed energy which enables creation of an energy-efficient operation schedule of household appliances. Analysis of the dependence of the forecast accuracy on the choice of input characteristics was made. As a result, the optimal number of neurons in the inner layer was empirically set to 250 with a prediction error within 5 %. Influence of weather factors on accuracy of the resulting forecasts was considered. In particular, it has been found that quite significant differences between actual and projected data (up to 12 %) are due to the inaccuracy of local forecasts.

One of the major challenges in the control and operation of microgrids is managing the fluctuating renewable energy generation, as well as sudden load changes that can affect system frequency and voltage stability. To solve the above problems, hierarchical control techniques have received wide attention. At present, although some progress has been made in hierarchical control systems using classical control, machine learning-based approaches have shown promising features and performance in the control and operation management of microgrids. This paper reviews not only the application of classical control in hierarchical control systems in the last five years of references, but also the application of machine learning techniques. The survey also provides a comprehensive description of the use of different machine learning algorithms at different control levels, with a comparative analysis for their control methods, advantages and disadvantages, and implementation methods from multiple perspectives. The paper also presents the structure of primary and secondary control applications utilizing machine learning technology. In conclusion, it is highlighted that machine learning in microgrid hierarchical control can enhance control accuracy and address system optimization concerns. However, challenges, such as computational intensity, the need for stability analysis, and experimental validation, remain to be addressed.","2023-06-01","2024-01-24 11:18:09","2024-01-24 11:18:09","","","","11","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001009761200001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo revisa não apenas a aplicação do controle clássico em sistemas de controle hierárquico nos últimos cinco anos de referências, mas também a aplicação de técnicas de aprendizado de máquina.

In those cases, state estimation cannot be performed using traditional approaches without pseudo-measurements. To address the lack of observability, this article presents the design and implementation of a novel three-phase state estimation method for unobservable and unbalanced AC microgrids, using machine learning techniques, without pseudo-measurements, and under heteroscedastic (i.e., non-constant variance) noise. The proposed machine learning state estimation (MLSE) makes full use of multiple candidate models trained with a small number of power flow simulations via OpenDSS, through random levels of demand and renewable generation in every simulation, enhanced through a proposed Tikhonov regularization operator. To deal with the heteroscedastic nature of measurements, a recursive average model is proposed to accurately estimate the state variables. Results are obtained using real data from a microgrid located on the main campus of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in Brazil. The method can be easily adapted to microgrids with different configurations, distributed energy resources, and measurements. It is shown that the proposed MLSE outperforms the traditional weighted least square (WLS) state estimator.","2022","2024-01-24 11:18:09","2024-01-24 11:18:09","","123387-123398","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000912624000001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo é dedicado ao uso de algoritmos de ML em diferentes fontes de energia renováveis ​​e à ponte entre ML e MPC para alcançar uma gestão de energia sustentável.

The intermittent nature of RESs brings several challenges to the smart microgrids, such as reliability, power quality, and balance between supply and demand. Thus, forecasting power generation from RESs, such as wind turbines and solar panels, is becoming essential for the efficient and perpetual operations of the power grid and it also helps in attaining optimal utilization of RESs. Energy demand forecasting is also an integral part of smart microgrids that helps in planning the power generation and energy trading with commercial grid. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models are promising solutions for predicting consumers' demands and energy generations from RESs. In this context, this manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of the existing DL-based approaches, which are developed for power forecasting of wind turbines and solar panels as well as electric power load forecasting. It also discusses the datasets used to train and test the different DL-based prediction models, enabling future researchers to identify appropriate datasets to use in their work. Even though there are a few related surveys regarding energy management in smart grid applications, they are focused on a specific production application such as either solar or wind. Moreover, none of the surveys review the forecasting schemes for production and load side simultaneously. Finally, previous surveys do not consider the datasets used for forecasting despite their significance in DL-based forecasting approaches. Hence, our survey work is intrinsically different due to its datacentered view, along with presenting DL-based applications for load and energy generation forecasting in both residential and commercial sectors. The comparison of different DL approaches discussed in this manuscript reveals that the efficiency of such forecasting methods is highly dependent on the amount of the historical data and thus a large number of data storage devices and high processing power devices are required to deal with big data. Finally, this study raises several open research problems and opportunities in the area of renewable energy forecasting for smart microgrids.","2021-07","2024-01-24 11:18:10","2024-01-24 11:18:10","","","","","144","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000649675700002","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo fornece um levantamento das abordagens existentes baseadas em Deep Learning, que são desenvolvidas para previsão de energia de turbinas eólicas e painéis solares, bem como previsão de carga de energia elétrica.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>I1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Deep learning; Machine learning; Renewable energy; Artificial neural networks; Energy forecasting; MANAGEMENT; PREDICTION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BIG DATA; COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; OF-THE-ART; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; SOLAR-RADIATION; TIME-SERIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A requisite for the provision of these services is that forecasts of aggregated production need to be highly reliable in order to minimize the risk of not providing the service. Yet, a reliability greater than 99% is unattainable for standard forecasting models. This work proposes alternative models for the day-ahead prediction of the lowest quantiles (0.1% to 0.9%) of renewable Virtual power plant production. The proposed approaches derive conditional quantile forecasts of aggregated Wind/PV/Hydro production, obtained from tailored parametric models and machine learning models, including a Convolutional Neural Network architecture for predicting extremes. Reliability deviation is reduced up to 50% and probabilistic skill score up to 18% compared to Quantile Regression Forest. Forecasting models are subsequently applied to the provision of downward reserve capacity by a renewable Virtual power plant. Increased forecasting reliability leads to a higher reliability of the reserve capacity, but reduces the average reserve volume offered by the renewable aggregation.","2023-07","2024-01-24 11:18:10","2024-01-24 11:18:10","","3070-3084","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001017406700007","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Rede Neural Artificial</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O trabalho propõe modelos alternativos para a previsão do dia seguinte dos quantis mais baixos (0,1% a 0,9%) de produção renovável de usinas virtuais.

An effective solution to this problem is Demand Response (DR). Electric Water Heaters (EWHs) are considered ideal candidates for DR due to their energy storage capability. Due to the benefits, control strategies or techniques for EWHs have received considerable academic attention. The energy sec-tor has recently tapped into the disruptive artificial intelligence world to learn, among other related prior-ities, how to enhance operations, maintain energy resilience and improve consumer service. Consequently, this paper reviews the use of machine learning (ML) for optimization and scheduling of EWHs. The main contributions of this review paper are, firstly, to identify state of the art of energy optimization and scheduling of EWHs. Secondly, to review the current ML models for energy optimization and scheduling of EWHs in smart grids and smart building environment. While classical control strategies may deliver sub-stantial improvements, optimum efficiency may not be reached. ML has demonstrated clear advantages over classical control. Based on these conclusions, recommendations for further research topics are drawn. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Solar irradiance is determined by deterministic factors (i.e. the position of the sun) and stochastic factors (i.e. the presence of clouds). Since the stochastic element is difficult to model, this problem can benefit from machine learning techniques, like artificial neural networks. This work proposes a methodology to forecast GHI in short- (i.e. from 15 min to 60 min) and mid-term (i.e. from 60 to 120 min) time horizons. For this purpose, we designed, optimised and compared four neural network architectures for time-series forecasting, respectively based on: i) Non-Linear Autoregressive, ii) Feed-Forward, iii) Long Short-Term Memory and iv) Echo State Network. The original data-set, consisting of GHI values sampled every 15min, has been pre-processed by applying different filtering techniques. Our results analysis compares the performance of the proposed neural networks identifying the best in terms of error rate and forecast horizon.

This allows to use less complex and less accurate forecasting methods and to formulate low-dimensional scenario-based optimization problems, which are suitable for control applications. Additionally, the designer may trade performance for safety by interpolating between the conventional stochastic and worst case MPC formulations.

The effects of the transient surges are the most vital parameters that are used in the insulation coordination studies for integrated systems of smart grid. Therefore, the electromagnetic transient overvoltages caused by switching surges and faults on the smart grids are the competitive design issues. Moreover, the contingency analysis of either sources or loads patching/dispatching is one of the major issues in the design process of the power system grid. The transient overvoltages imposed over the integrated grid systems need to be more properly investigated using most sophisticated numerical methods. Although, the transient surges have relatively short durations, but it may cause severe overvoltages stresses for the insulation systems and consequently may yield to insulation failure. This paper presents the simulation of large-scale renewable energy resources integrating with the utility grid. The transient overvoltages appear over the utility grids due to different renewable energy resources are investigated. Moreover, the different methods that proposed to be used to suppress, mitigate, and control these overvoltages and to minimize their probable sever effects over the permissible insulation level (BIL) are elaborated. Furthermore, the full simulation of the IEEE 39 grid integrated with large Photovoltaic and wind farms using EMTP-RV /MATLAB is developed. In addition, different proposed methods to mitigate and to control internal surges are investigated. Finally, the obtained results are presented with very good consistency level and compliance with other research studies found in literature and with the different standards related to the renewable energy sources.","2021","2024-01-24 11:18:10","2024-01-24 11:18:10","","43262-43270","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000633626300001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo apresenta a simulação de recursos de energia renovável em grande escala integrados à rede elétrica.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Renewable energy sources; Smart grids; Transient analysis; Computational modeling; ENERGY-SYSTEMS; integration with power grids; large-scale renewable energy sources; Mathematical model; mitigation techniques; PROTECTION; Surges; Transient overvoltages in power grids; TRANSMISSION; Wind farms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nonlinear power losses of ac/dc converters and dc/dc converters under different operating modes are formulated as novel multivariate nonlinear functions of both power and voltage. These functions are approximated by linear surrogate models and adopted by the dynamic optimal power flow (OPF), where the voltage and power of the converters can be optimized considering the physical laws among voltages of converters. Embedding the dynamic OPF problem as mixed-integer recourse, a two-stage stochastic programming problem is formulated for the day-ahead operation of N-ac/dc-MGs. To reduce the computational cost, a finite iteration convergent Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the UC problem. Case studies are performed on hybrid ac/dc MGs and N-ac/dc-MGs.

In this work, comprehensive modeling of a grid of microgrids for faster-than-real-time (FTRT) emulation is proposed, which can be utilized in the energy control center for contingencies analysis and dynamic security assessment. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) modeling is applied to the microgrid in order to reflect the detailed device processes of the converter and renewable energy sources, while the AC grid utilizes the transient stability modeling to reduce the computational burden and obtain a high acceleration value over real-time execution. Consequently, a dynamic power injection interface is proposed for the coexistence of the two simulation types. The reconfigurability and parallelism of the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) enable the whole system to be executed in FTRT mode with 51 times acceleration over real-time.

The single-level controller uses two different models that yield different descriptions of the microgrid and use different sampling times. The model with a smaller sampling time provides a more detailed description of the microgrid, in order to keep track of the fast dynamics, while the model with a higher sampling time provides a less detailed description and is used for making long-term predictions when it is not needed anymore to track the fast dynamics. Moreover, we propose a novel RBMPC method that assigns the value to the binary decision variables in the hybrid microgrid model, e.g., ON or OFF status of the generators and charging or discharging mode of ESSs, through if-then-else rules, which rely on the price of electricity and the local net imbalance. The standard method of applying model predictive control (MPC) to a hybrid model results in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Our proposed rule-based method is able to convert the standard MILP problem into a linear one.

Modern MSGs are largely driven by power electronic converters due to their high efficiency and flexibility. Controlling MSGs is a challenging task due to requirements of power availability, safety and voltage quality within a wide range of different MSG topologies resulting in a demand for comprehensive testing of new control concepts during their development phase. This applies, in particular, to data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning, of which the stability and operating behavior can hardly be evaluated on an analytical basis. Therefore, the OpenModelica Microgrid Gym (OMG) package, an open-source software toolbox for the simulation and control optimization of MSGs, is proposed. It is capable of modeling and simulating arbitrary MSG topologies and offers a Python-based interface for plug & play controller testing. In particular, the standardized OpenAI Gym interface allows for easy data-driven control optimization. The usage and benefits of OMG for designing and testing data-driven controllers are demonstrated utilizing Bayesian optimization. Both the current and voltage control loops of a voltage source inverter operating in standalone, grid-forming mode for a remote MSG are automatically tuned given an uncertain application environment.

However, the uncertainties of renewable energy sources and the time coupling characteristic of electric vehicles bring great challenges of non-anticipativity and feasibility for supply-demand coordination. To satisfy the non-anticipativity, we develop a supply-demand coordination optimal model using pre-scheduling method with virtual re-scheduling. In this model, the current decision only depends on the current and past realizations of random variables. Furthermore, we enhance the model with time-coupled robust constraints to guarantee the feasibility of the strategy under all possible realizations of the random variables. These time-coupled robust constraints bring high computational complexity to solve this model. So, we develop the method of combining forward recursion and backward recursion to decouple these time-coupled robust constraints in time. In this way, the coordination model is transformed to a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model which can be efficiently solved. Finally, numerical test based on a real case is analysed and the results show that the energy cost of the enterprise is about 136129$ if the flexible load is about 20% and load shifting and generators rescheduling can reduce the energy cost more than 6%. Note to Practitioners-This study is encouraged by the challenging problem caused by the multi-distributed energy introduced into an enterprise microgrid. In enterprises, as the large-area flat workshop roof assists in convenience for photovoltaics' development and the EVs are widely used, the issue to best utilize renewable energy and EVs shows vital significance in reducing the energy cost. However, there exist the following three main challenges: (eq1) the non-anticipativity of the model, (eq2) the solution's feasibility under all possible realizations, and (eq3) the effectiveness of the solution method. For the concerns of non-anticipativity, we develop the model using a pre-scheduling model with virtual re-scheduling in which the current decision only depends on the current and past realizations of random variables. To handle the second challenge, an ideal of scenario model with robust constraints is developed considering both feasibility and economy. In order to solve the model with robust constraints, the all-scenario-feasible method and a combination of the forward recursion and backward recursion method are used to deal with time-independent and the time-coupled robust constraints, respectively. The numeric results demonstrate that load shifting and generators rescheduling can reduce the energy cost more than 6%, and using the method with the forward and backward recursion process can reduce the energy cost more than 9%.","2022-08-24","2024-01-24 11:18:11","2024-01-24 11:18:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000846391100001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O estudo desenvolveu um modelo ótimo de coordenação oferta-demanda utilizando o método de pré-agendamento com reescalonamento virtual.</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Costs; Microgrids; Optimization; Uncertainty; Renewable energy sources; Load modeling; OPTIMIZATION; WIND POWER; OPTIMAL OPERATION; Computational modeling; backward recursion; Coordination optimization; forward recursion; multi-renewable energy sources; RENEWABLE ENERGY; robust constraints; UNCERTAINTIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most efficient approaches to reduce energy losses is to integrate distributed generations (DGs), mostly renewable energy sources. However, the uncertainty of DG may cause instability issues. Additionally, due to the similar consumption habits of customers, the peak load period of power consumption may cause congestion in the power grid and affect the energy delivery. Energy management with DG regulation is considered to be one of the most efficient solutions for solving these instability issues. In this paper, we consider a power system with both distributed generators and customers, and propose a distributed locational marginal pricing (DLMP)-based unified energy management system (uEMS) model, which, unlike previous works, considers both increasing profit benefits for DGs and increasing stability of the distributed power system (DPS). The model contains two parts: 1) a game theory-based loss reduction allocation (LRA); and 2) a load feedback control (LFC) with price elasticity. In the former component, we develop an iterative loss reduction method using DLMP to remunerate DGs for their participation in energy loss reduction. By using iterative LRA to calculate energy loss reduction, the model accurately rewards DG contribution and offers a fair competitive market. Furthermore, the overall profit of all DGs is maximized by utilizing game theory to calculate an optimal LRA scheme for calculating the distributed loss of every DG in each time slot. In the latter component of the model, we propose an LFC submodel with price elasticity, where a DLMP feedback signal is calculated by customer demand to regulate peak-load value. In uEMS, LFC first determines the DLMP signal of a customer bus by a time-shift load optimization (LO) algorithm based on the changes of customer demand, which is fed back to the DLMP of the customer bus at the next slot-time, allowing for peak-load regulation via price elasticity. Results based on the IEEE 37-bus feeder system show that the proposed uEMS model can increase DG benefits and improve system stability.","2015-12","2024-01-24 11:18:11","2024-01-24 11:18:11","","1607-1616","","6","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000366141100034","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>No artigo, é considerado um sistema de energia com geradores e clientes distribuídos e é proposto um modelo de sistema unificado de gerenciamento de energia (uEMS) baseado em preços marginais locacionais distribuídos (DLMP) que considera tanto o aumento dos benefícios de lucro para as GDs e aumenta a estabilidade do sistema de energia distribuída (DPS).

Small-scale renewable energy sources, controllable loads, energy storage devices, and other nonrenewable sources are effectively integrated to form a virtual power plant (VPP). Uncertainty in forecasting renewable energy generation due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources is one of the biggest challenges in VPPs. Power generation by RESs changes with the day of the week, season, location, climate, and resource availability. Also, load demand and utility price vary with time and need to be forecasted for proper energy management of VPPs. However, the dispatching and planning of VPPs are significantly impacted by the volatile nature of RESs, load demand, and utility price. Predicting these uncertainties with high accuracy is essential to balance the electrical power generation and the load demand. In this article, a decision tree (DT) algorithm is proposed, to predict the uncertainty parameters, such as the day-ahead power from the RES, load demand, and utility prices of VPPs. The efficiency of the proposed model and the predicted results are compared with other complex models, such as the artificial neural network (ANN) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms. Root-mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and mean absolute error (MAE) are the statistical metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction. One-year meteorological data of the Chennai zone in India is considered for predicting the uncertainty parameters. IEEE 16-bus and 33-bus test systems are used to validate the forecasting model. It is evident from the results that the proposed DT algorithm can predict the uncertainty parameters more accurately and use lesser time than the ANN and ARIMA algorithms.","2023-10-02","2024-01-24 11:18:12","2024-01-24 11:18:12","","1756-1769","","16","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000983858900001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo, é proposto um algoritmo de árvore de decisão (DT), para prever os parâmetros de incerteza, como a potência diária das RES, a demanda de carga e os preços dos serviços públicos dos VPPs.

In smart grids, power generations and loads become intermittent and much more uncertain, and the topology also changes more frequently, which may result in significant state shifts and further make NRPF or FDPF difficult to converge. To address this problem, we propose a data-driven PF (DDPF) method based on historical/simulated data that includes an offline learning stage and an online computing stage. In the offline learning stage, a learning model is constructed based on the proposed exact linear regression equations, and then the proposed learning model is solved by the ridge regression (RR) method to suppress the effect of data collinearity.

In particular, the optimal bidding curve describes the cost-minimizing buying/selling strategy of prosumers and is composed of a limited number of linear segments. As such, only a small number of end points of the linear segments are sufficient to exactly describe the optimal bidding curve. This not only guarantees the optimality of bidding decisions, but also greatly reduces the computation and communication overhead compared with existing sampling-based approaches. By leveraging the proposed systematic bidding strategy, we propose a novel market clearing scheme for the distribution system operator (DSO) to coordinate the energy transaction among prosumers in a local distribution area (LDA). Specifically, when all prosumers, either grid-connected or isolated, follow the proposed optimal bidding strategy, the DSO is able to achieve a global optimal distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch in a decentralized manner. We verify the proposed bidding strategy and market clearing scheme in two practical scenarios, i.e., a prosumer with 34 buses in a distribution-level energy market and an LDA with four 13-bus microgrids. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared with other benchmarks.","2020-05","2024-01-24 11:18:12","2024-01-24 11:18:12","","1695-1706","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000529523600003","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>O artigo desenvolve uma abordagem sistemática para derivar a estratégia de licitação ideal para prossumidores em um mercado de energia no nível de distribuição</p> <p><strong>#eligible</strong></p> <p>E1</p> <p><strong>#FIM</strong></p> </div>","","","Microgrids; Reactive power; microgrids; Renewable energy sources; Electricity market; Topology; Energy resources; sensitivity analysis; GENERATION; OPTIMIZATION; MICROGRIDS; Computational modeling; RENEWABLE ENERGY; market bidding strategy; optimal energy management; Systematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, these resources are inserted at the distribution level and feed consumers locally with better reliability. The planning and stable operation of the power networks are complicated at numerous levels as a result of large-scale renewable integration, as the infeed from renewable sources like wind and solar is highly intermittent and uncertain, significantly affecting the resilient, intelligent, and optimal operation of the power system. The creation of scenarios is an essential step in the planning and stable operation of renewable-rich power systems. Scenarios can be generated based on seasonal events to mitigate growing complexity and intermittency. In this paper, time-series solar data is used for forecasting solar irradiance using long-short-term memory (LSTM). Besides, a cost-based optimisation model has been developed by using stochastic programming to obtain both the optimal sizing and optimal switching sequence of distributed units as well as the optimal number of required units. The stochastic nature of solar and load demand is considered in beta (beta) distribution. The objective function formulated covers different costs, like capital, operational, and switching costs associated with required units. The running cost incorporated with the capital cost gives us a broader design for planning the MG, thus making it both planning and operational problem. The entire proposed MG planning problem has been developed in a Python and MATLAB (R) environment.","2023-08-11","2024-01-24 11:18:12","2024-01-24 11:18:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001048399200001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>#RSL</strong></p> <p><strong>#technique_used</strong></p> <p>Não se aplica</p> <p><strong>#desc_technique</strong></p> <p>No artigo, dados solares de séries temporais são usados ​​para prever a irradiância solar usando memória de longo e curto prazo (LSTM).

Now, this detailed SSM of inverters alongside loads and network gives a system of systems architecture to the MGs, modeling of which leads to a higher-order system with a large number of states. In this work, the SSM of a standard MG system is developed using simplified lower-order models of solar PVs and batteries that incorporate generation uncertainties by considering the dynamics of both input dc and output ac terminals of the inverter. The obtained reduced order model is computationally more efficient. The MG test system includes two PV sources having dedicated parallel RLC loads and low voltage feeder.

This novel concept compromises numerous challenges such as controlling DERs and consumers in a home microgrid (H-MG), based on historical data and market clearing price (MCP), which requires multi-objective analysis and an energy management system (EMS). Initially, tremendous issues emerged when integrating these systems with RGBs. Therefore, multi-agent systems (MAS) are capable of utilizing parallel computing as a control method, where each RGB represents as an agent with independent decision-making capability, while productively cooperating with other agents. In this paper, an effective EMS has been presented with MAS (EMS-MAS) for DER in a neighborhood grid, accompanied by several RGBs. The RGB includes controllable and uncontrol-lable devices by residents and building management systems (BMS), where controllable devices are HVAC and home appliances (e.g: dishwashers, washing machines), and uncontrollable devices are lighting systems, flexible heating and cooling demands, respectively, along with several electrical loads (e.g: lighting system, A/C, refrigerator, etc.) and thermal loads (e.g HVAC systems, water heater, ovens, etc.) with retailers who sell and buy electricity to/from residents.

In this work, we tune different controllers for an Interleaved Boost Converter (IBC) powered by a photovoltaic array using three metaheuristics: Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Gray Wolf Optimization. We also develop several controllers for a second simulated scenario where the IBC is plugged into an existing microgrid (MG) as this can provide relevant data for real-life applications. In both cases, we consider hybrid controllers based on a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). However, we hybridize it with an Integral action (I-LQR) in the first scenario to compare our data against previously published controllers. In the second one, we add a Proportional-Integral technique (PI-LQR) as we do not have previous data to compare against to provide a more robust controller than I-LQR. To validate our approach, we run extensive simulations with each metaheuristic and compare the resulting data. We focus on two fronts: the performance of the controllers and the computing cost of the solvers when facing practical issues. Our results demonstrate that the approach proposed for tuning controllers is a feasible strategy. The controllers tuned with the metaheuristics outperformed previously proposed strategies, yielding solutions thrice faster with virtually no overshoot and a voltage ripple seven times smaller. Not only this, but our controllers could correct some issues liaised to the IBC when it is plugged into an MG.

This article presents a novel method for the prediction of RE generation and electricity load using improved stacked gated recurrent unit-recurrent neural network (GRU-RNN) for both univariate and multivariate scenarios. First, multiple sensitive monitoring parameters or historical electricity consumption data are selected according to the correlation analysis to form the input data. Second, a stacked GRU-RNN using a simplified GRU is constructed with improved training algorithm based on AdaGrad and adjustable momentum. The modified GRU-RNN structure and improved training method enhance training efficiency and robustness. Third, the stacked GRU-RNN is used to establish an accurate mapping between the selected variables and RE generation or electricity load due to its self-feedback connections and improved training mechanism. The proposed method is verified by using two experiments: prediction of wind power generation using multiple weather parameters and prediction of electricity load with historical energy consumption data.

It is crucial to allocate appropriate reserve capacity for the economic and reliable operation of IMGs. With the high penetration of RESs, it faces both economic and environmental challenges if we only use spinning reserve for reserve support. To solve these problems, a multi-type reserve scheme for IMGs is proposed according to different operation characteristics of generation, load, and storage. The operation risk due to reserve shortage is modeled by the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method. The correlation of input variables is considered for the forecasting error modeling of RES and load, and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is adopted to generate the random scenarios of the forecasting error, so as to avoid the dimension disaster caused by conventional large-scale scenario sampling approaches. Furthermore, an optimal day-ahead scheduling model of joint energy and reserve considering risk-based reserve decision is established to coordinate the security and economy of the operation of IMGs.

First, we analyze the cyber and physical attack impacts (including cyber attacks on the solar inverter causing unusual harmonics) on electric waveforms in the distribution power grids. Then, we construct a high-dimensional streaming data feature matrix based on signal analysis of multiple sensors in the network. Next, we propose a novel mechanism including leverage score-based attack detection and binary matrix factorization-based attack diagnosis. By leveraging the data structure and binary coding, our HCADI approach does not need the training stage for both detection and the root cause diagnosis, which is needed for machine learning/deep learning-based methods.

Off-grid microgrids rely on renewable energy sources (RES) coupled with storage systems to supply the electrical consumption. The inherent uncertainty introduced by RES as well as the stochastic nature of the electrical demand in rural contexts pose significant challenges to the efficient control of off-grid microgrids throughout their entire life span. In this paper, we address the lifelong control problem of an isolated microgrid. We categorize the set of changes that may occur over its life span in progressive and abrupt changes. We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to address both types of changes. In particular, the proposed algorithm demonstrates generalisation properties, transfer capabilities and better robustness in case of fast-changing system dynamics. The proposed algorithm is compared against a rule-based policy and a model predictive controller with look ahead. The results show that the trained agent is able to outperform both benchmarks in the lifelong setting where the system dynamics are changing over time. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims to dispatch multiple devices operating in different timescales to sectionalize the distribution system into self-supplied MGs and supply the critical loads continuously with reliable power. In the hour-ahead operation stage, switches, capacitor banks and energy storage charging/discharging decisions are optimized based on hour-ahead interval predictions of renewable energy generations and load demands. In the intra-hour operation stage, the output of distributed energy resources and static Var compensators are redispatched to compensate the hour-ahead operation decisions after the uncertainty realization. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed MG scheduling method can restore more critical loads and sustain secure operation under random renewable energy generation and load demand. In addition, to address uncertainties, the MG scheduling problem is modeled as a robust optimization model, which is decomposed into a master problem and a subproblem by adopting the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Furthermore, the subproblem is reformulated via the disjunctive programming method to reduce the computational complexity.

Nevertheless, coordinating HESS through optimized energy management strategies (EMS) introduces complexity. The latter has been previously addressed by the authors through a systems-level graphical EMS via Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA). Although of proven efficiency, accounting for uncertainty with PoPA has been an issue, due to the assumption of a perfect day ahead (DA) generation and load profiles forecast. This paper proposes three adaptive PoPA-based EMS, aimed at negating load demand and RES stochastic variability. Each method has its own merits such as; reduced computational complexity and improved accuracy depending on the probability density function of uncertainty. The first and simplest adaptive scheme is based on a receding horizon model predictive control framework. The second employs a Kalman filter, whereas the third is based on a machine learning algorithm. The three methods are assessed on a real isolated HESS microgrid built in Greece. In validating the proposed methods against the DA PoPA, the proposed methods all performed better with regards to violation of the energy storage operating constraints and plummeting carbon emission footprint.

Furthermore, a multi-stage distributionally robust optimization (MSDRO) model is set up in this paper to address the temporal uncertainties in the day-ahead economic dispatch model. Compared with the traditional two-stage distributionally robust optimization, the proposed multi-stage approach provides more flexibilities so that the decision variables can be adjusted at each time period, leading to a complex nested formulation. To efficiently solve the MSDRO model, a stochastic dual dynamic programming method is employed to decompose the original large-scale optimization model into several sub-problems in the stages, as two steps: forward pass and backward pass. In the forward pass, the expected cost-to-go function is approximated by piecewise-linear functions and then several samples are used to generate a lower bound; the backward pass will generate Benders' cuts at each stage from the solution of the forward pass. The forward and backward passes are performed iteratively until the convergence is reached.

Additionally, managing shared energy usage and trade in smart buildings continues to be a significant difficulty. The main goal of solving such problems is to flatten the aggregate power consumption-generation curve and increase the local direct power trading among the participants as much as possible. This study provides a coordinated smart building energy-sharing concept for smart neighborhood buildings integrated with renewable energy sources and energy storage devices within the building itself. This neighborhood energy management model's primary objective is to reduce the total power cost of all customers of smart buildings in the neighborhood by increasing the use of locally produced renewable energy. In the first stage, a group of optimum consumption schedules for each HEMS is calculated by an Improved Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (IBOA). A neighborhood energy management system (NEMS) is established in the second stage based on a consensus algorithm. A group of four smart buildings is used as a test system to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested neighborhood smart building energy management model. These buildings have varying load profiles and levels of integration of renewable energy. In this paper, the proposed framework is evaluated by comparing it with the Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and W/O scheduling cases. With applying GWO, the total electricity cost, peak load, PAR, and waiting time are improved with 3873.723 cents, 21.6005 (kW), 7.162225 (kW), and 87 s respectively for ToU pricing and 11217.57 (cents), 18.0425(kW), 5.984825 (kW), and 98 s respectively for CPP tariff. However, using the IBOA Improves the total electricity cost, peak load, PAR, and waiting time by 3850.61 (cents), 20.1245 (kW), 6.7922 (kW), and 53 s respectively, for ToU and 10595.8 (cents), 17.6765(kW), 5.83255(kW), and 74 s for CPP tariff.
