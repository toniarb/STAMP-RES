Smart Technologies Applied in Microgrids of Renewable Energy Sources: A Systematic Review

Abstract: The production of electricity from renewable sources has become a global necessity due to concerns about reducing carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions into Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The use of microgrids has emerged as a potential scenario in this production process, especially with the application of smart technologies integrated into decision making. This article used the PRISMA method to identify the intelligent techniques employed in the context of microgrids from 2015 to 2023, totaling 156 articles. The results indicate progress in the use of artificial neural networks and multi-agent systems in environments of, respectively, predictability and management, and open space for discussions involving the incorporation of new techniques aimed for future implementations.
